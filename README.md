The problem is worse... even worse than anyone can imagine.

till 1964, coins were 90% silver
minimum wage was $1.25 per hour
which was 1.125 ounces of silver from the coins, or could have purchased 1.25 ounces of silver,
or 0.035 ounces of gold internationally

that 1964 minimum wage, today equates to $33 of melt value in the coins, and $91 of gold.
Silver has lost far more value than gold, as silver supply increases roughly 5% per year compared to gold's 2%
That is, the true value of $1.25 in 1964 was not just $33 of silver melt value, nor even the $91 worth of gold value.. as gold suffered a 2% per year inflation. You would need well-over $100 of buying to understand a $1.25 in 1964.

What about even earlier? When we had a gold standard, and $20 was an ounce of gold. Before this age of abundance that cane from technological and engineering innovations. An unskilled worker could earn a mere $0.25/hr, $10/week, $520/yeer

And a skilled worker would easily double or triple that amount, with an average salary of $1300.

Measured in gold, and ignoring the 2% per year inflation in the gold supply, the unskilled worker is earning a half ounce of gold every week. The average salary of that era would be 65 ounces of gold! Today that's $170,000 worth of gold!

What happened?! We debased our money, which is merely a measure of value. We debased ourselves.
We finally noticed that there is a growing and unsustainable wealth disparity.
Our age of abundance has ironically caused this, or rather, it has allowed this problem to go unnoticed for so long, growing like a cancer, and only now has the problem grown so large that it's impossible to ignore.
And even now we want only to sustain the cancer, maybe live with it as it's been with us so long.
But it is a cancer. Either we die, or the cancee is removed. It cannot sustain.

Gold has proven its value during this ordeal.
And Bitcoin was created, a more scarce asset than even gold.
Digital scarcity.


There was no inflation resistant asset in the past, but there was massive productivity gains and an explosion of supply that should have decreased prices on pretty much everything except land. Instead ptices went up. way up.

Even as we saw this age of abundance, prices went up. Wages didn't just stagnate they dropped considerably (measured in gold or even in silver). Everyone became poor without even realizing it, and there was no correction to the abuses of fiat. No one noticed because their living standards seemed to increase or stay about the same (despite all the abundance that should have nade everyone rich). People nade more fiat than their parents, but life was getting harder not easier (again deapite the abundance), and eventually things got so bad that life for the younger generations became worse than their parents' generation.
This is when we noticed.

And now we look back and can see how bad things really are.. a minimum wage should have the buying power of well over $100 per hour today, because that's how much abundance exists in the modern world.

The abundance is now being threatened, because we're not contending with individual bsnkers, we're contending with evil. And evil seeks our destruction.
Bitcoin is necessary for society to increase in abundance. As now anyone can opt-out of this evil abd simply store wealth that will not inflate like ailver or gold. 
Any workee can now save the pure energy money, the equivalent of a 1964 minimum wage being valued at over $100/hr today.

An "engineer" would make $2500 salary, or 125 ounces of gold, or $325,000 ... whivh shows how much money is still available when there's sufficient demand.

Bitcoin csn fix this. It was designed specifically to fix this.
The fiat price of Bitcoin will only increase. It's dominance is inevitable.
Bitcoin's buying power will reflect growing abundance of our modern world.
The price onlu grows sustainably as a measure of civilization growing.






----
unit of account arbitrage
...
theory, even early on adoption, prices in Bitcoin represent a more accurate signal than feet.
If this is true, then one should be able to create an investment strategy based on comparative prices in Bitcoin over time -- such that:
+ X vs Y, priced in Bitcoin should be stable, but if X > Y, then Y is underpriced and one ought to buy Y as an arbitrage.

this strategy requires assets that should be stable over time relative to one another, and differ only due to cantillion effects such that the Bitcoin price acts as a signal for an upcoming correction.

this can include index funds, cars, classic artwork, gold, housing, and really anything with a functioning market.

track prices over time for:
+ spi
+ median family home
+ most popular car
+ McDonald's cheeseburger
+ barrel of oil
etc


when to buy:
all prices in Bitcoin, look for stability and create indexes to discover arbitrage opportunities, e.g., oil price (in Bitcoin) drops, while the others do not, buy oil company stock..

note: this is different than relative value changes, because we're looking only for cases where the price in Bitcoin drops but only for one of the assets, that is,
+ it's not just a sudden drop in BTCUSD
+ it's not just a decrease of one asset to another (oil getting cheaper relative to spi - in this case oil would have to get cheaper relative to the other assets AND its price in Bitcoin must go down)

when to sell:
when the price of X (in Bitcoin) falls back in line with the other assets.
Again, Bitcoin is merely acting as the cleaner price signal, revealing arbitrages in the fiat system.
