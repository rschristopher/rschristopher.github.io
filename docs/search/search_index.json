Money also stores value,  value to be used in the future.   The time between earning money   and spending money  is known  as \"saving\".</p> <p>This simple and subjective sense of value  is all that money is and ever will be. It is best understood as a technology,  such that good money will be more efficient  than bad money.  It can be strong money with  a fixed supply, or it can be easy money  with an inflationary supply.</p> <p>Inflationary money  disprupts the natural cycle of saving,  replacing the age old \"saving for the future\"  with consumerism,   with credit and debt,   with a system of constant spending --  because money that constantly loses value  is simply worth more now than it will be   in the future.</p> <p>Fiat money is inflationary at the whims  of those who control the money supply. There is a  reason janitors have less purchasing power than   ever before. And it's not because a wealthy  person controlled this outcome. If you are a janitor earning fiat money,  you will work harder  and harder, but you will earn   less and less value over time.  And that amount of lost value will be gained by those known as   cantilion insiders,   those close to the money supply, those  who benefit from increases in the money supply,  including art collectors.</p> <p>An art collector's salary  will also lose value over time,  just like the janitor. However, assets such as real-estate  and art will increase in value.  Inflating the money supply  doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods,  it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering  wealth from those who work and save, to those  who own hard assets. And if you dig deep enough, you'll find  that most art collectors don't actually  earn a salary,  have never earned a salary,  and that their wealth is not  stored in cash.</p> <p>Political solultions make the problem worse,  and over time those controlling the money  supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as seigniorage)  to control the politics (regardless of the system),  so it inevitably becomes a rigged game  (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise). Revolutions change the faces of the problem,  but like the word implies, a revolution is  to move in a circle.</p> <p>There is no political solution.</p> <p>If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse   modern societies are   struggling with consumerism, environmental   catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly  \"wealthy\" populations are malnourished and  dying younger, and fighting endless wars over  control of oil -- look no further than  the source of all this misery -- fiat money,  where unaccountable bureaucrats control  the supply of money at the expense  of civilization itself.</p> <p>While the current round of non-sustainable  monetary parasitism began in   1971,   this   problem is as old as time.

Bitcoin simply could not succeed in an honest system.

The existing global fiat system has tenuous dependencies on USD as the global medium of exchange for crude oil (the so-called \u201cpetrodollar\u201d system). And separately there exists global foreign exchange (forex) markets where fiat currencies are traded, arbitrages are sorted, and prices are discovered.</p> <p>Unlike a gold standard, where the exchange rate could be settled based on the precious metal content of coins, global forex requires a vastly more complicated system that reduces the number of financial sovereigns (that is, the number of nation states that can create their own fiat). Even now without a gold standard, there are far more mints (public and private) creating gold coins and bullion than there are sovereign nation states with their own fiat money. All one needs is gold. This is because the value of gold depends only on its demand, with very little seigniorage possible, and no forex market necessary.</p> <p>Bitcoin takes this to an extreme of eliminating seigniorage entirely. If Bitcoin survived into the year 2140, there will be no new Bitcoin and no opportunity for seigniorage. Additionally, blockspace will be constrained to roughly 210-million transactions per year. And while this is easily enough to absorb the 50x increase in value (as measured in gold) discussed previously, is this enough to cover a global demand of 12-billion people?</p> <p>In other words, could Bitcoin become a victim of its own success, as blockspace itself becomes too scarce, necessitating secondary layers that fail to offer the assurances one finds with on-chain settlement? Put simply, how could Bitcoin scale globally? And how does this compare to fiat?</p> <p>The short answer is no, it does not scale. On-chain transactions (final international settlement) clearly cannot scale to a global population of 12-billion. With only 210-million transactions per year possible, base-layer transactions will effectively be limited to a population of tens-of-millions maybe a hundred million max. Scaling beyond that will require secondary layers such as lightning, but even lightning necessitates on-chain transactions. In fact, any secondary layer will by definition require on-chain transactions in order to achieve the security and backing made possible by the base layer.</p> <p>Ultimately, if there are 12-billion people looking to use Bitcoin, only a small minority of millions (say 50 to 100-million people) will be able to do so on the base layer. While this sounds unfair, it's important to contrast this with fiat. Those millions of people making on-chain transactions are themselves financial sovereigns.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the number of fiat sovereigns is limited to the number of fiat currencies, which is under 200. Not thousands, not millions, and in fact only a handful of fiat currencies cover nearly all the value (USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, etc). This produces a defacto global oligarchy of central banks in a winner-take-all game where weaker fiats are absorbed into stronger fiats (e.g., so-called \u201cdollarization\u201d). Ultimately, the fiat game is not scalable globally over time.</p> <p>Contrast this with Bitcoin where anyone who transacts on-chain is the equivalent of a financial sovereign, able to provide liquidity into any secondary layer. Importantly, if Bitcoin is to survive and flourish into the year 2140, then secondary layers must be available to all without necessitating on-chain transactions. That is, an existing lightning channel must itself be scalable to multiple participants rather than be limited to a single user (as it is now).</p> <p>Prerequisite 4</p> <p>In order for Bitcoin to survive to the year 2140, secondary layer channels (such as lightning channels) must allow for multiple participants per channel, in other words, multiple private keys per channel.</p> <p>There are no technological barriers to achieving such a world of tens of millions of financial sovereigns, however, these secondary layers must never supplant or weaken the demand for base layer transactions sufficient to maintain the security of the network.

And even if multiple participants could share the same channel, those participants could not provide their own liquidity and benefit from 2nd layer transaction fees the way the sovereign can. The incentives for 2nd layer fees must be sufficient to encourage the far more costly on-chain transactions.

Neither gold nor fiat nor real-estate nor even fine-art  can function as a better store of value than Bitcoin.</p> Fiat Volatility <p>Bitcoin is often criticized as being \"too volatile\". However, even as measured in fiat, Bitcoin is by far the highest-performing asset of all time. And considering that 80% of all USD was created in the last 5 years, one may want to consider that it is fiat volatility that is confusing price signals -- after all, the Bitcoin supply has stayed fixed and predictable, with growing adoption.</p> <p>For better or worse, Bitcoin price movement is a slow process of price discovery -- as those who understand the fundamentals of money would never sell Bitcoin for fiat, and ultimately Bitcoin finds its way into stronger hands, sending its fiat price higher and higher.

The performance gain is achieved through a high\u00adlevel optimization of the Bitcoin mining algorithm which allows for drastic reduction in gate count on the mining chip.\u201d</p> <p>In simpler terms, ASICBoost is an optimization based on the insight that the 80-byte block-header is divided into two chunks when computing a SHA-256 hash (a Bitcoin block hash is a double SHA-256 of the 80-byte block-header). The SHA-256 hash function uses 64-byte chunks of the message to hash, and processes each chunk into an expander function, and finally into a compressor function to produce the final 32-byte (256-bit) output.</p> <p>From a SHA-256 perspective, here is how a block-header will be chunked:</p> <p> </p> <p>When iterating on the Nonce, nothing in Chunk 1 would change. Once the Nonce in Chunk 2 is exhausted, the extranonce field in the coinbase will increment, requiring a new Merkle Root and a new Chunk 1.</p> <p>In pooled mining, there are multiple extranonce fields in the coinbase, typically:</p> <ul> <li>extranonce1 \u2013 a unique value between the stratum server and the miner; this will not change by the miner but is set by the pool itself (unique each miner)</li> <li>extranonce2 \u2013 an additional field (immediately after extranonce1) that is incremented by the miner when it exhausts the nonce space</li> </ul> <p>A \u201ctraditional mining loop\u201d follows this exact approach, an outer-loop that modifies Chunk 1, and an inner-loop that modifies Chunk 2. The \u201cASICBoost loop\u201d flips this approach such that multiple Chunk 1 values can be used for each Nonce (each Chunk 2); effectively eliminating one of the expander functions that would be required in the traditional loops (see the research paper for details).</p> <p>The goal is to find Chunk 1 \u201ccollisions\u201d (that is, different values of Chunk 1 that do not effect the last 4-bytes of the Merkle Root, which is part of Chunk 2).</p> <p>The theoretic performance improvement is up to 25% (removing one of the expander functions); and the more Chunk 1 collisions one can find the better the gains.

This method is known as \u201ccovert\u201d because it\u2019s nearly impossible to detect, because in practice it would be indistinguishable from normal Merkle tree rolling that one would see in the \u201ctraditional mining loop\u201d (that is, changing the extranonce2).</p> <p>It may seem difficult to find collisions, 4-bytes is 32-bits, thus 2^32 of brute force hashing, but due to the birthday paradox we can find collisions in <code>sqrt(2^32)</code>. Thus within 65K brute force attempts we can find 4-byte collisions. In other words, we don\u2019t need a specific 4-bytes, we just need as many 4-byte collisions as we can find.</p> <p>Discovering Merkle Root collisions can be done by modifying the transactions, as well as by re-ordering transactions.

This is a cryptographic function that  takes any input (in this case a block) and   generates a 256-bit number as output.

In fact, all PoW does is provide a verifiable  block hash that is smaller than the current  network difficulty. In other words, the hash is simply a number  (a 256-bit number) that is smaller than  the network difficulty number. This is why you see leading zeroes.</p> <p>The reason this is a proof of work  is because generating a valid block  requires massive amounts of work. A Bitcoin miner constantly  adjusts a proposed block   (see the <code>nonce</code> in the header)  and generates a sha256 hash,  essentially a guess. Every miner repeats this, over and over,  until finally -- and by dumb luck --  the hash is smaller than the network difficulty. If the hash is valid (adhering to consensus rules)  then the rest of the network will accept the  proposed block.</p> <p>There is also a <code>timestamp</code> field in each block,  meaning the Bitcoin network is also a distributed  timestamp server. This allows the PoW blockchain to keep track of time. And due to what is known as the  difficulty adjustment,  the network will adjust the   difficulty number in order to maintain a 10-minute average block time. The difficulty will adjust  every 2016 blocks (roughly every 2-weeks; and 2016 reversed is 6102,  a subtle reference to   executive order 6102).

You feel stupid sending your bank a selfie, but you do it anyway.</p> <p>The bank also asks you to select and answer three \"security questions\", and you go with your high-school mascot, name of your first pet, and the city you met your significant other (Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken).</p> <p>The password manager also requires its own \"strong password\" and in case you forget that one, they provide you a \"secret key\" that they recommend  you print out and keep someplace safe. This \"secret key\" they tell you, can be used to recover all of your passwords, so you have to keep it very safe.</p> <p>You write down the following on a piece of paper,</p> <p>6QRDjV7MmznW63yjZWM5c8ngC5rxQhZxAPXrzfuYbg8CZuLT</p> <p>and you put that paper in a fire-proof lockbox.</p> <p>We could keep going with this all-too-common tale of security theater   (and you've no doubt already experienced much of this),  but let's pause here  and analyze how easy and how secure this system really is --</p> Security Review <p>In practice, your personal information has certainly been leaked out to the dark web multiple times (through any one of the high-profile data breaches that you read about in the news). Tying your wealth to personal information is generally a bad idea, but impossible to avoid with institutional custody.</p> <p>A fire-proof lockbox would not preserve a piece of paper through a house fire.</p> <p>Regardless, there's a much bigger problem -- a barely competent hacker could call your bank and impersonate you. With a quick glance at your social media, they could answer the security questions (Cherokees, Rex, Hoboken), then they reset the password, change the security questions, liquidate the account, and finally they close the account.</p> <p>If this happens, you'll find yourself locked out of your own account, and after weeks of calling the bank and getting a lawyer involved you will eventually learn what happened. Your account was liquidated. The bank assumes no responsibility, and they give you the number for the FBI. They blame the whole ordeal on your weak security questions  and point to the terms and services that you signed (but never read).</p> <p>In case it's not obvious, online banking is vastly more complicated  than anything you'll encounter with Bitcoin.  And you'll find all the same cryptographic concepts,  such as private keys and recovery seeds, but the bank and apps will  apply them in comically useless ways that add no real security  and still manage to leave you vulnerable.</p> <p>No reasonable person would conclude that the current state  of online security is easy.  Securing your identity across disparate technology  and banking providers is not easy.  And worse, it is getting harder and harder by the day.</p> <p>But is Bitcoin really as easy as changing a light-bulb?</p> <p>Yes, and definitely easier than  the security theater of online banking.</p> <p>Bitcoin is new and can seem complicated. But imagine asking a person from the  middle ages to change a light bulb.  They'd be confused and  without explicit instructions they would probably electrocute themselves.</p> <p>Bitcoin is no different.  Future generations may laugh at us for being so hopelessly ignorant of what will seem obvious and intuitive to them.</p>"},{"location":"saving/sovereignty/#really-its-easy","title":"Really, It's Easy","text":"<p>Securing your assets in the traditional fiat banking system requires  a Rube-Goldberg-Machine of security-theater  where telling a call-center operator in the Philipines  your mother's maiden name  somehow constitutes security.</p> <p>Bitcoin self custody offers real security.

By adhering to these rules you ensure maximum security for your savings.</p> <p>To achieve nuclear-launch-code-level security, follow these rules as a concise, numbered checklist. Each includes a brief rationale for clarity and enforcement. The focus is on absolute isolation, verifiable processes, and layered defenses against physical, digital, and human threats. Adhere to them without exception during any session involving seeds or transaction signing.</p> <ol> <li> <p>No device or data crosses the quarantine except via QR codes: Limit transfers between the Transaction-Manager and Airgapped-Computer to visual QR codes only; ban USB, MicroSD, or any physical media to eliminate malware vectors. Rationale: Prevents hidden payloads; QR enforces manual verification.</p> </li> <li> <p>Expose seed phrases only on the Signing-Device: Never display, write, or input seeds on any other component; derive keys solely within this isolated environment. Rationale: Contains the most critical secret to one tamper-resistant point, reducing theft risk.</p> </li> <li> <p>Stow all smartphones and personal electronics in Faraday bags outside the room: Power them off first and place in shielded bags; assume they are actively compromised for surveillance or key theft. Rationale: Blocks remote activation of microphones, cameras, or transmitters.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ban all electronic devices near the Signing-Device: Exclude speakers, smart devices, fans, or anything with potential for acoustic/electromagnetic leaks; use a dedicated, shielded room if possible. Rationale: Mitigates side-channel attacks like audio-based data exfiltration.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure complete physical privacy: Conduct sessions away from windows, in a locked room with no line-of-sight exposure; use white noise generators or RF shielding if available. Rationale: Guards against optical surveillance (e.g., drones, lasers) or thermal imaging.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sanitize and verify all tools pre-session: Check software/firmware signatures on official sources; wipe temporary media and test for integrity; treat every component as potentially compromised. Rationale: Counters supply-chain attacks and ensures no pre-installed malware.</p> </li> <li> <p>If possible, require multi-person verification for critical steps: Involve a trusted witness for seed loading or signing; use time-delayed access (e.g., 24-hour locks) to deter coercion. Rationale: Adds human redundancy against ransom or insider threats.</p> </li> <li> <p>Post-session wipe and audit: Clear RAM on shutdown, log all actions, and test quarantine integrity periodically (e.g., simulate breaches quarterly). Rationale: Erases residual data and detects subtle violations early.</p> </li> <li> <p>Distribute and redundantly store components: Keep Signing-Device elements geographically separate. Rationale: Ensures resilience against localized physical attacks like burglary or fire.</p> </li> </ol> <p>These rules, when followed meticulously, create a fortress-like barrier, making unauthorized access exponentially difficult\u2014even for advanced adversaries.
