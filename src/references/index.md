Online information about Bitcoin is rife with scams -- from fake giveaways and phishing sites to rug-pull "altcoins" and fraudulent exchanges and "yield" products promising high returns. It's easy to lose everything if you chase quick gains or trust without verifying. 

Finding pure signal amid the noise is challenging, but sticking to time-tested, open-source, and community-vetted resources is key. Avoid anything promoting "get rich quick" or alternatives to Bitcoin; focus on education and self-sovereignty. And always remember to question everything, never trust, always verify.
