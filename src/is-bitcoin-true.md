# Is Bitcoin True?

One of the strangest realizations I had when
 I first learned about Bitcoin,
 was the thought,

> *Bitcoin fixes modern art?*

Bitcoin
 -- *if it is true* --
 fixes all of the problems of fiat money,
 *even modern art*.

## The problem of fiat money

Bitcoin was designed to
 fix the problem of fiat money, 
 which is the problem of politics and money, 
 an incessant problem that has
 burdened human civilization throughout
 history.

You may have gotten into Bitcoin as
 an investment;
 a high-risk and volatile investment;
 an investment into the best performing
 asset of all time.
And yet, Bitcoin was
 not designed to be an investment.
Bitcoin was designed to be money,
 sound money that can fix the problems
 of fiat money -- it is in this regard
 that we ask: *is Bitcoin true?*

The problems of fiat money run deep, 
 beyond the ever-increasing
 price of meat and potatoes -- shaping
 Politics and War,
 Food and Health,
 Education and Research,
 Science and Innovation --
and yes, even *modern art*.

## Even modern art?

???+ warning "modern art under fiat"
    ![banana taped to wall](/images/banana.jpg)

    This is an actual piece of art -- 
    [that sold](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/maurizio-cattelan-banana-explained-1732773),
    and appreciated to over [6-million dollars](https://www.npr.org/2024/11/21/nx-s1-5199568/a-duct-taped-banana-sells-for-6-2-million-at-an-art-auction).

    There are many such examples, along with 
    eye-roll inducing apologetics, such
    that the banana represents a critique of the
    very problems of modern art that everyone
    is criticizing.
    Janitors [protested](https://news.artnet.com/art-world/cattelans-banana-ignited-protests-among-miami-based-janitors-1731435)
    the banana for pay inequality,
    another artist ate the banana,
    and still another wrote "Epstein didn't kill himself" on the wall in red lipstick.

    ![banana in gallery](/images/banana_photos.jpg)

    Even the artists and the art
    dealers know that modern art is vapid nonsense,
    and so they perform self-referential pieces
    of art, criticising themselves, being
    cynical about cynicism --
    someone will then call the self-referential
    cynicism "genius" -- and why stop
    if the money keeps rolling in?
    
    Rather than ask *what is* and *what is not* art,
    instead ask how art collectors have money for this kind of art,
    and why they see value in it.
    And most importantly, 
    find out where that money came from.

## Where does money come from?

Money operates as a measure of value,
 subjective value based on the perceptions of
 those buying and selling.
 Money also stores value,
 value to be used in the future. 
 The time between earning money 
 and spending money
 is known
 as "saving".

This simple and subjective sense of value
 is all that money is and ever will be.
It is best understood as a technology,
 such that good money will be more efficient
 than bad money. 
It can be strong money with
 a fixed supply, or it can be easy money
 with an inflationary supply.
 
Inflationary money
 disprupts the natural cycle of saving,
 replacing the age old *"saving for the future"*
 with consumerism, 
 with credit and debt, 
 with a system of constant spending --
 because money that constantly loses value
 is simply worth more now than it will be 
 in the future.

Fiat money is inflationary at the whims
 of those who control the money supply. There is a
 reason janitors have less purchasing power than 
 ever before. And it's not because a wealthy
 person controlled this outcome.
If you are a janitor earning fiat money,
 you will work harder
 and harder, but you will earn 
 [less and less value over time](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/).
 And that amount of lost value will be gained by those known as 
 cantilion insiders, 
 those close to the money supply, those
 who benefit from increases in the money supply,
 including art collectors.

An art collector's salary
 will also lose value over time,
 just like the janitor.
However, assets such as real-estate
 *and art* will increase in value. 
Inflating the money supply
 doesn't just drive up prices of consumer goods,
 it first inflates the value of hard assets, transfering
 wealth from those who work and save, to those
 who own hard assets.
And if you dig deep enough, you'll find
 that most art collectors don't actually
 earn a salary,
 have never earned a salary,
 and that their wealth is not
 stored in cash.

Political solultions make the problem worse,
 and over time those controlling the money
 supply use their ill-gotten gains (known as *seigniorage*)
 to control the politics (regardless of the system),
 so it inevitably becomes a rigged game
 (be it a democracy or theocracy or socialist dictatorship or otherwise).
Revolutions change the faces of the problem,
 but like the word implies, a *revolution* is
 to move in a circle.

!!! warning "There is no political solution."

If you ever wonder why seemingly diverse 
 modern societies are 
 struggling with consumerism, environmental 
 catastrophes, health epidemics where supposedly
 "wealthy" populations are malnourished and
 dying younger, and fighting endless wars over
 control of oil -- look no further than
 the source of all this misery -- fiat money,
 where unaccountable bureaucrats control
 the supply of money at the expense
 of civilization itself.

While the current round of non-sustainable
 monetary parasitism began in 
 [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/), 
 this 
 problem is as old as time. Whether it's 
 causal or not can be debated, but societies
 fall when their money is debased
 (just ask the Romans).
 No reasonable person can believe otherwise.

The real question becomes, 
 what can be done about the problem of fiat money?

## The terrifying truth

*If* Bitcoin is true, it is almost too terrifying to contemplate.
Bitcoin simply could not succeed in an honest system.
It is 
 merely a set of protocols around
 a cryptographic ledger
 designed to prevent any and all
 centralized control of money;
 it requires voluntary participation;
 it is designed
 such that no one can or will control the
 [monetary policy](bitcoin-as-money/monetary-policy.md).
As a consequence of its design,
 it is slow and less efficient than
 what a non-corrupt centralized system could
 achieve. It is only superior to corrupt
 dishonest systems
 (because it fixes the bad-actor problem).

If Bitcoin is true it would mean that
 the problems of fiat money are 
 not only real
 but irreconciliable.
It would mean our entire system is built on lies, 
 and that
 our leaders are parasitic sociopaths,
 selected by broken incentives that
 benefit short-term gains at the expense
 of the future,
 unknowingly
 destroying civilization in the process.

And it means that we have been participants in this lie.

For Americans it means Nixon was worse than 
 liberals believe, and that
 FDR was even worse than Nixon.
It means our media is corrupt propaganda,
 and that our political parties are nothing
 but the coordinators of this propaganda.
And none of this is by design but is a consequence
 of the fiat system itself;
 of the broken incentives that reward
 short-term gains at the expense of civilization.
Such a system will
 discourage you from ever discovering,
> *where does money come from?*

This is a lot to take in for even a cynical person.
You've been lied to about money,
 by people who aren't particularly competent,
 told that
 *money doesn't grow on trees* and then
 to look the other way when money is created
 from nothing;
 all by the whims of
 parasitic sociopaths that know
 not what they do.

It's tempting to believe the lies, either that
 *they* don't exist (it's all just a conspiracy theory)
 or to believe *they* exist and are competent enough to
 actually control money.
But the terrifying truth is that *they* do exist,
 but are completely incompetent.
They don't
 understand that one cannot actually control money.
 *No one can control money*, because
 money relies on the ever-changing perspectives of value of
 every person on earth.

!!! info "Money is technology"
    Money is the technology that allows for the ever-changing
    perspectives of value 
    (of every human on earth) 
    to be made
    known and measurable,
    that is, to have what are known as *prices*
    and *markets*.

    Money requires freedom, freedom to change your mind
    on a whim, to change your perception of value
    based on the ever-changing demands in your life.

One cannot control money without controlling the
 subjective values of every person on 
 earth, controlling not just their thoughts, but 
 their innate sense of value, and
 all the externalities that might cause them to react,
 rendering them less than cattle, 
 less than rats, 
 something more akin to cogs in a machine,
 a machine that is 
 controlled by -- *who exactly?*

## "Bitcoin fixes this"

This oft-repeated quote struck me as
 too good to be true, the wishful thinking
 of youthful idealists who are all theory
 with no real-world experience,
 those unprepared for the chaotic 
 realpolitik of life.

And yet, if what is claimed about Bitcoin is
 true, then it *could* fix
 the damaging effects of inflationary money.
 If the supply is truly scarce, 
 now and in the future; 
 and if the network is truly decentralized, 
 such that no
 system of authority can control or kill it,
 then yes, logically, Bitcoin could
 fix many of the problems
 of fiat money.

But like I said, that all seems
 too good to be true.
Like trying to contemplate what life would
 be like if people were always honest and 
 forthright; if everyone was kind, humble,
 and forgiving. People aren't always that way, 
 and it's not helpful to pretend otherwise.

And yet, Bitcoin assumes the opposite, that no one 
 can be trusted.

!!! quote "don't trust, verify"

The entire design of Bitcoin is a trustless system
 that assumes no one is honest. No one.
You must verify everything.
If there's something we can't verify, then trust
 is required, in which case we're back to fiat,
 back to the very problem that Bitcoin is trying to solve.

For Bitcoin to be true, *everything* must be verifiable.






---

## Why not other Cryptocurrencies?

Altcoins are not attempting to solve 
 the problem Bitcoin solves.
 They offer no scarcity, and no true
 decentralization.
 Most are free market monies that
 operate as securities.
 They sometimes offer interesting features
 because 
 they're digital money,
 but without scarcity over time.

Most are merely copies of Bitcoin but 
 with a centralized source of control,
 completely defeating the point,
 which is why you will hear them referred
 to as "shitcoins".

Shitcoins cannot solve the problem
 of fiat money. And they don't try.
In all cases they are attempting to become
 fiat money, granting seigniorage to
 their own founders.
Bitcoin is in a category all its own,
 a scarce digital resource,
 a superior money.

If Bitcoin is true, then it wins in the end,
 outcompeting all other money,
 potentially
 redeeming civilization in the process.
Anything less than that would prove
 Bitcoin false.

## What if Bitcoin is false?

*What if* in our journey to verify *everything*
 we miss something?
And years later we realize that there
 was a flaw, something we didn't see,
 but it becomes obvious once exploited.

That's all it would take to prove Bitcoin false
 -- one small counterexample, 
 a flaw that could not be fixed in a [soft fork](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/blockchain/soft-fork/).
If trust was required,
 then that trust could be exploited
 -- and those who
 most effectively violate that trust would
 become the de-facto controllers of Bitcoin,
 making it no better than fiat.

> *What then?*

Nothing will have been fixed.
The unsustainable problems of fiat
 would continue in crisis after crisis.
However, having learned about Bitcoin
 you'll understand money. 
The chaos of the moderm world will 
 make sense.
And you'll realize we needed Bitcoin to be true 
 because there was no alternative.

Whether we like it or not, the
 survival of our civilization 
 depends on overcoming the problem of fiat money.
This is the challenge of our generation.
The existential threats
 facing our civilization
 all point back to fiat money.
We cannot solve environmental crises,
 health crises, meaning crises,
 or any of the problems
 in education or politics, not
 without fixing the broken incentives
 that created those problems to begin with.

Bitcoin has been referred to as *energy money*,
 one of the 
 *great filters* to the advancement
 of civilization.
This is a polite way of saying
 that civilization cannot advance when
 parasitic bureaucrats
 play God through vain attempts
 at controlling money.
But this also means, for Bitcoin to be true,
 it must succeed as *energy money*;
 it must be the catalyst to advance our civilization.

All Bitcoin would have to do is work. 
 Every day that it works is another day 
 that it has
 not been proven false.
We can dare to hope;
 we can look for
 [criticisms](/criticisms); or
 we can support Bitcoin's ascent as a true
 form of energy money that redeems
 civilization.
The stakes are higher than we can imagine, 
 and what happens next,
 for better or worse, is up to us.
