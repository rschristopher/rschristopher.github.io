In the year 2525
If man is still alive...

Do you need an on-chain transaction to receive
 lightning payments?
If yes, this is a scaling problem.
Can a user receive lightning payments from
 an existing channel?
That is, can a channel support multiple
 users?
The equivalent of a HD wallet for lightning.
In other words, an existing channel could then
 add multiple parties as potential recipients.

Perhaps this is best thought of as a layer 3.
The lightning transactions are always 2-2 multisig
 being bounced back and forth.
This is the game of sovereigns.
What's missing is your % of that.

~50 million sovereigns
12 billion subjects, all working with
 one or more sovereigns.

How does the sovereign pay their subjects?
157-million transactions per year, maybe 10-1000
times the number of transaction outputs.
In other words, the average sovereign has ~1000
 outputs per lightning channel.
If each output could be put into an L3 lightning
 wallet, then all subjects could easily work
 for one or more sovereigns.
The L3 wallet is just a Bitcoin wallet, an
 address is used as the basis of their L3
 payments.
Make as many as you want, the L3 takes those
 as pseudonymous payment destinations, creating
 payments based on an address and a UTXO
 (or a designated L2 amount).
You can get paid only when there's a UTXO
 cryptographically signed to your address
 and part of the existing channel.
L3 simply needs to ensure no double spending,
 exactly as L2 does.
E.g., make an L2 payment
 and use that to designate L3 funds?
This way an employer locks real wealth to your
 address, with a covenant for you to get paid,
 should you deliver the work.
Once the money is yours, it's yours... 
You can be a sovereign if you so choose, or
 just save and spend it on L3 rails.

Cold storage on L3, it's yours afterall,
 or put it on L2, the inter-sovereign layer.

Sovereign -- base layer
Inter-sovereign -- L2
Inter-payments -- L3
