**Straightforward. Transparent. No bullshit**

You don’t need us to use Bitcoin well -- but if you want one-on-one support, we offer it at competitive, transparent pricing.

We charge based on time and scope, not complexity. Pricing below gives examples of what typical engagements look like.

## FAQ

**Do you offer flat-fee packages?**  
Yes — for custody setups, BTCPay deployments, and small engagements.

**Can you work with multisig I already started?**  
Absolutely. We’re happy to review or refine an existing setup.

**Do you ever take custody or hold client keys?**  
No. Never.

**Do you charge more if the amount held is high?**  
No. Pricing is based on scope, not assets. In fact, do not ever disclose your exact assets, that's between you and your loved ones, never with us.

**Is your pricing negotiable?**  
If you’re working on something aligned with our mission, reach out. We care more about helping the right people than maxing out invoices.
