# Bitcoin as Money

If Bitcoin is true,
 it must be Hayek's *"something"* 
 that government can't stop.
It must be a de-facto superior
 money to USD, as well as to all fiat money.
It must be so superior that it's ascent is
 only a matter of when and not if -- this is
 the only way Bitcoin could be considered *true*.

## Global Money

Money is the technology that makes known the
 ever-changing perspectives of value of every
 human being on earth.
Additionally, money must store value over time,
 and it must be transmittable over large distances,
 anywhere that humans wish to transact.

There has never been a true *global money*,
 that is, a money that everyone on earth
 agrees on as their 
 [unit of account](unit-of-account.md),
 their
 [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md),
 and as their 
 [store of value](store-of-value.md).

Such a technology has never existed,
 least of all because such a global money
 must be properly 
 decentralized and uncensorable. 
Importantly, anyone who controls monetary technology
 would have power over everyone else wishing to
 transact with that money.
A global money could only be possible if 
 no one controlled it.

As such, Bitcoin can only be true if
 *no one* can control
 or limit who can use it.
This means attempts to ban it must fail,
 as well as attempts to subvert or control
 its monetary policy.

## Gold and Silver

The closest to a global money was gold and silver.
 One could travel with gold, and use it
 in most places, provided it was not seized
 or stolen.

Kingdoms and empires fell,
 but if their coins were in
 gold, the monetary value of that gold was
 preserved and spendable elsewhere.
Wars were fought over gold,
 and if you managed to hold onto your
 gold, not a paper note but the gold itself,
 that gold would hold its value over time.

For example,
 under the gold standard $20-USD was *roughly* an ounce of gold.
An unskilled worker might earn only 25-cents per hour --
 *a mere $40 per month* --
 2-ounces of gold per month.
At today's gold price this is
 well over $30/hour.

*Gold-backed money provided a living wage
 to even the lowest paid workers.*

Unfortunately, gold cannot be transmitted
 quickly nor cheaply over large distances.
This limitation gives rise to an inevitable
 system of credit,
 and then to promisory notes
 which then lead to fractional reserve,
 and stey-by-step to pure fiat;
 money that is backed by-- *what exactly?*

## Petrodollar

Today, the world operates on a quasi-global
 currency known as the USD, or more aptly,
 the 
 [*petrodollar*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-hidden-costs-of-the-petrodollar).
It began after 
 [1971](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/),
 after a sovereign debt default which
 ended what was left of the gold standard.
 
For all its faults,
 the 
 [*petrodollar*](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-hidden-costs-of-the-petrodollar)
 system makes the USD a stable *global reserve currency* which
 is why you can freely exchange
 your USD to Canadian dollars or Euros or Yen
 or Yuan.
Almost anywhere on earth you go,
 you can probably find an ATM that will 
 allow you to withdraw the local currency
 (at a relatively stable exchange rate).
Despite the many problems of fiat money,
 this innovation was itself revolutionary,
 allowing decades of economic growth
 on a global scale.

The dirty secret was that this economic growth
 hid the seigniorage of central bankers
 that has inadvertantly bankrupted
 every country on earth,
 [strip mined capital](https://allenfarrington.medium.com/the-capital-strip-mine-ec627e9fe40a),
 transformed stockpiles of wealth into an unsustainable
 mountain of debt that can never be paid back
 (it is money backed by debt afterall).

And of course, the not-so-secret secret,
 this system requires
 continuous war over oil.

![petrodollar](/images/petrodollar.jpg)

The petrodollar system depends on two critical elements,

1. US military dominance
2. US relations with oil-rich nations (like Saudi Arabia)

In other words, if Saudi Arabia and other oil-rich nations should fall,
 the USD petrodollar would collapse overnight.
Similarly, if the US military was not the de-facto
 dominant power on earth, then the USD would collapse
 (hyperinflating against stronger money).
Likewise, if the US government was to collapse, 
 so too would the USD petrodollar system.
This bizarre web of dependencies
 is what it means today to be
 the *global reserve currency*.

Unlike gold and silver, the petrodollar
 depends entirely on the US government, the US Treasury,
 the Federal Reserve, the US military, the Saudi government,
 and a stable relationship between the US and the Saudis.

## Fiat Interregnum 

While fiat is (by definition) legally enforced as a [medium of exchange](medium-of-exchange.md),
 it fails as a [store of value](store-of-value.md), distorting price signals,
 and ultimately failing as a reliable [unit of account](unit-of-account.md).
Fiat money inevitably creates a [dual money system](https://river.com/learn/files/river-dual-money-era-2024.pdf?ref=blog.river.com),
 where weak "currency" is separated from monetary "assets"; in other words, the masses earn fiat while the wealthy store value in hard assets (gold, real-estate, equities, or even fine-art).

Bitcoin need not be adopted nor even accepted by the
 fiat bureaucrats;
 the truth of Bitcoin is not determined by fiat.
For Bitcoin to be true, it need only to work.
International settlements must work using 
 Bitcoin. And doing so will reveal the
 impotence of the parasitic bureaucrats
 that imagine themselves as in control.
Bitcoin is true because it works,
 and the consequences of that may not be
 agreeable to most 
 (least of all to the beneficiaries of the fiat system itself).

The fiat system produces bureaucratic
 cruft, delusions of power that arise
 from the noise of the system, obscuring
 price signals and creating a class of 
 professional bureaucrats
 whose job it is to pretend
 to control money.
Bitcoin doesn't make them obsolete,
 it proves they have been impotent all along,
 like court astrologers.

Under the gold standard, it wasn't the king
 that gave value to money, 
 it was the gold.
 The monetary value of gold was 
 all that mattered.
Similarly, under a Bitcoin standard,
 Bitcoin is all that will matter,
 not its adoption by bureaucrats.

In the long arch of history, the modern fiat system
 is a mere blip as we transition from gold
 to true global money.
This blip of modern fiat was birthed in 1971 
 although didn't really
 prove itself till a few years later.
By the 1980s it was ostensibly working, 
 and it was uncontested until 2009, 
 until Bitcoin. 
And in a sly roundabout
 way, Bitcoin has risen into prominence as
 an open source global money, poised to supplant
 the USD petrodollar.
And with every
 decade of it working, it inches
 closer to becoming the money of
 international settlements,
 the base layer behind all money.
