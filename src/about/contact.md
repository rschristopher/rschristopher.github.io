**Bitcoin is True** exists to help individuals and businesses achieve real sovereignty — not just buy-and-hold convenience.

We're not a company built on buzzwords or marketing funnels. We're a consulting and development practice rooted in real-world Bitcoin use. We've worked with clients ranging from family offices securing generational wealth to solo entrepreneurs integrating Lightning payments.

We believe Bitcoin should be simple, private, and durable.  
We help people get there — or build it themselves with confidence.
