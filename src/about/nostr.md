## What is Nostr?

Nostr is a *protocol* for decentralized social networking.
In other words, you can use *any* Nostr client and you'll be
 looking at the same social network.
This replaces twitter, telegram, and any other
 centrally controlled social network -- allowing
 an open and uncensorable social network.

Technically, email and websites are based on
 similar protocols.
Imagine if one company owned all websites and all email --
 censoring your emails and prohibiting what you
 can write on your own website --
 this is effectively what social media companies
 have attempted.
Nostr simply puts the power back in the hands
 of the user.
You decide what you want to read, not an "algorithm"
 written by moral busybodies and propagandists.

As such, a Nostr client app is like a web browser.
Regardless of which web browser you use,
 you will be looking at the same website.
Regardless of which Nostr client you use,
 you will be looking at the same Nostr feed.

## Why is Nostr?

The early Internet was decentralized:
 emails, websites, usenet groups, gopher,
 private FTP sites, or even the infamous
 bulletin board systems (BBS) -- all were
 completely decentralized and uncensorable.
Users did not reveal their personal identity,
 preferring pseudonymous "handles".
Using a personal identity was considered,
 well, too personal.

Most all of this still exists, relegated to
 the so-called *darkweb* and nearly forgotten.
Even personal websites fell out of favor,
 all replaced by the
 dystopian surveillance panopticon
 brought about by FAANG companies and their ilk.
Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and
 Google -- along with the other *"big tech"*
 companies that never made it into that dumb
 acronym (Twitter, Microsoft, Slack, etc).

Few questioned the wisdom of this centralized
 corporate fascism,
 ignoring the heavy-handed influence of government
 and military "defense" agencies --
 let alone the corrosive influence of political
 parties and the various dictators and human
 rights abusers
 (often calling themselves *activists*
  and other absurdities).
Not only are *true names* the expectation,
 they are increasingly required --
 with pressure from nation states
 (and unelected central planners)
 to encourage and even 
 enforce this level of tracking.
Everything you do and say, both online
 and off, what you type, where you're sitting,
 your buying habits, your political views,
 everything -- all these formerly
 private details are
 aggressively and repeatedly tracked in
 a comically inefficient 
 Rube Goldberg surveillance machine,
 with your identity 
 bought and sold for immoral
 uses that prior generations would have
 only imagined in a sci-fi novel.

!!! example "Are you being tracked?"
    Even reading this blog has likely triggered
    dozens of surveillance trackers,
    each adding data to your digital profile
    (the device you are using, how long you stayed
    on this page, your physical location, mouse
    and/or touchpad movements, everything) --
    this profile is then sold, where yours and
    billions of other profiles are endlessly
    compared and experimented via 
    machine learning models with
    predictions of what you'll buy next,
    where you'll go, who you'll likely vote for,
    and of course: your level of conformity
    into this draconian system that
    no one asked for.

Meanwhile, Nostr continues the tradition
 of a decentralized Internet.
There are no identities other than what
 you choose to reveal.
The default is
 complete privacy through pseudonyms --
 specifically through
 public/private keys.

An "identity" in Nostr is simply a public key.
All messages are signed by a corresponding
 private key.
You can create as many keys as you want.
That is, as many pseudonyms as you want.
You can even use new keys every time,
 effectively providing anonymous access
 without any hurdles.

Meanwhile, payment integration is baked in
 natively with lightning.
Rather than monetizing through attention,
 engagement, and other measures that did nothing
 but fuel the dystopian nightmare that is our
 modern surveillance state -- instead Nostr
 monetizes through, well, money.
Rather than desperately track personal details
 and whorishly seek attention, Nostr simply
 uses Bitcoin over lightning rails.
Anyone can pay anyone, all pseudonymously.

And since Nostr is a protocol, different
 clients can use Nostr for a variety of use
 cases, effectively disrupting almost all
 products and services from those
 FAANG companies.
Like what the Internet did to publishing houses
 and record stores, Nostr is poised to do to
 our labyrinthine social media hellscape.

If Twitter, Facebook, Tik-Tok and the others
 are to survive the next decade,
 it will likely be
 as Nostr clients.
Or Facebook will go the way of Kodak,
 Google the way of IBM,
 and so on --
 replaced by more competent
 companies that understand
 the direction of society.
If you don't think this
 could happen, consider
 that this is what already
 happened when these
 FAANG companies were young
 start-ups and supplanted
 the old tech giants,
 all building on top of
 Internet protocols like HTTP.

## Creating Keys

To get started on Nostr, you'll need to generate a public/private key pair. Most Nostr clients can do this for you.

Your private key (nsec) is your password -- keep it secret and secure. The public key (npub) is your identity, share it freely.




---

## Creating a verified username

To create a verified username like `user@domain.com`, set up a 
[NIP-05](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md)
identifier. This links your public key to a domain you control, proving ownership without central authority.

Steps:

- Add a JSON file to your domain's `.well-known/nostr.json` path with your npub.
- Update your Nostr profile with the identifier.

This adds credibility, like a blue checkmark but decentralized.

## Linking to a Lightning Address

Link a Lightning Address to your Nostr profile for seamless zaps (tips) via Bitcoin's Lightning Network. Use services like [Wallet of Satoshi](https://walletofsatoshi.com/) or self-host with [Alby](https://getalby.com/).

In your Nostr client, add the address to your profile. Receivers see it as a zap button -- instant, low-fee payments without intermediaries.
