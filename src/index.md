## Why Self-Custody Matters

If your Bitcoin is on an exchange or with a custodian, it isn't truly yours. 
Bitcoin enables complete sovereignty.
We're here to help you:

- Design a secure multisig vault
- Set up cold storage the right way
- Understand inheritance planning
- Gain confidence handling your keys

You will learn to do it yourself. We make sure you do it right.

## Bitcoin Payments, Done Right

Accepting Bitcoin should be seamless and sovereign.  
We help you integrate:

- Lightning Network payments

- Full ownership of your payment stack

Whether you're a merchant, freelancer, or enterprise, we help you eliminate middlemen -- permanently.

- Understanding ASICs
