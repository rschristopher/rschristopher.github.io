## Why It Matters

Bitcoin’s value makes your home a target for thieves and violent attackers. FBI data reports a burglary every 25.7 seconds in the U.S., with 58% involving forced entry. A “wrench attack” ([https://xkcd.com/538/](https://xkcd.com/538/)) — where a thief uses force to demand your assets — will endanger a family without preparation. Natural disasters like fires add further risk. Physical security counters these threats, ensuring your loved ones and your savings remain protected.

## The Role of Firearms

Firearms are a critical defense against violent threats like a wrench attack ([https://xkcd.com/538/](https://xkcd.com/538/)). If a criminal uses force to demand your Bitcoin — firearm beats wrench. Certified training (e.g., USCCA Defensive Shooting Fundamentals) builds skills: situational awareness, safe handling, and precise response under stress. Training covers de-escalation, legal use, and marksmanship, preparing you to protect your family during a home invasion. 

Concealed carry training and permits extend this defense to public spaces, ensuring safety during travel or daily routines. Store firearms in safely to prevent unauthorized access, and practice regularly at a range. With millions of defensive gun uses annually in the U.S. (FBI estimates), firearms, paired with training, provide a vital shield for your household.
