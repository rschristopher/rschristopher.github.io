What if your signing devices and seed phrases were destroyed in a fire?

For significant Bitcoin holdings, metal backups of your seed phrases ensure your private keys survive extreme conditions like fire, flood, or physical damage.

A metal seed backup, created using stainless steel dog tags, provides a fireproof, waterproof, and corrosion-resistant copy of your seed phrase. Generic metal stamping enhances security by allowing you to source materials independently, avoiding reliance on commercial Bitcoin seed backup solutions.

## Why Metal Seed Backup?

A metal seed backup ensures your Bitcoin seed phrase withstands disasters that would destroy paper or digital backups. By stamping your seed phrase into stainless steel or titanium, you create a resilient, long-term artifact.

Generic metal stamping, using dog tags or fender washers, enhances security by avoiding commercial Bitcoin seed backup solutions, which may involve unverified supply chains that could compromise privacy.

## Which Metal?

Not all metals resist environmental damage or are suitable for stamping. The table below compares common metals for hardness (Vickers scale, higher is better for stamping durability) and melting temperature (for fire resistance):

| **Metal**       | **Hardness (Vickers)** | **Melting Temperature** | **Suitability for Seed Backup** |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Stainless Steel | ~200–250 HV           | ~2,500°F (1,370°C)     | Excellent: Affordable, corrosion-resistant, durable, easy to stamp. |
| Titanium        | ~300–350 HV           | ~3,000°F (1,660°C)     | Superior: Lightweight, extremely durable, fire-resistant, slightly harder to stamp. |
| Aluminum        | ~25–50 HV             | ~1,220°F (660°C)       | Poor: Soft, prone to scratches, low fire resistance. |
| Silver          | ~25–70 HV             | ~1,760°F (960°C)       | Poor: Soft, tarnishes, less durable for stamping. |
| Gold            | ~20–30 HV             | ~1,947°F (1,064°C)     | Poor: Very soft, expensive, unsuitable for stamping. |

- **Stainless Steel**: Affordable and corrosion-resistant. Widely available in grades 304 or 316.
- **Titanium**: Ultra-durable, lightweight, and fire-resistant but more expensive and slightly harder to stamp. Ideal for high-value backups.
- **Tungsten Stamping Kit**: Use a tungsten or steel stamping kit with letter stamps. Tungsten stamps are harder, ensuring clear imprints. Available at craft stores or online retailers.

Avoid softer metals like aluminum, silver, or gold, which are less durable and harder to stamp legibly. Verify material quality to ensure durability.

## Creating a Metal Seed Backup

!!! warning "*No paid nor influenced content* -- all views are from personal experience"

Stamp your seed phrase into stainless steel dog tags or fender washers. Generic materials, like dog tags, enhance security by allowing you to control the supply chain and verify materials independently.

While commercial products exist, the [MicroSeed](https://21e15.com/) stamp kit, which uses 1" stainless steel fender washers (available at hardware stores), is a reliable option. However, you can achieve the same result with dog tags and a stamping kit from craft stores.

???+ info "Materials Needed"
    - **Metal Medium**: Stainless steel dog tags or fender washers.
    - **Stamping Kit**: Tungsten or steel stamping kit with letter stamps.
    - **Stamping Surface**: A flat, hard surface like a steel anvil or brick for stable stamping. A brick is sufficient but may cause slight imperfections.

???+ note "Stamping Process"
    1. **Prepare the Seed Phrase**:
        - Retrieve the seed phrase from your signing device, written on a temporary paper backup during initial setup.
        - Work in a secure, private location with no electronic devices nearby.
    2. **Set Up the Stamping Area**:
        - Place the dog tag or washer on a flat, hard surface (e.g., steel anvil or brick).
        - Secure the medium with tape or a holder to prevent movement. Avoid stamping beyond designated areas to prevent damage.
    3. **Stamp the Seed Phrase**:
        - Use a tungsten stamping kit to imprint each word letter by letter. Apply light, consistent pressure for clear, legible imprints.
    4. **Verify the Backup**:
        - Test the backup by entering the seed phrase into a temporary, offline wallet (e.g., on a fresh Tails OS session) on a signing device.
    5. **Secure the Backup**:
        - Store the metal backup in a tamper-evident bag or container.
        - Place it in a secure, offline location (e.g., safe deposit box or home safe) separate from your signing device and [air-gapped computer](../appendix/airgapped-computer.md).

## Maintaining Your Metal Backup

To ensure your metal backup remains reliable:

- **Inspect Regularly**: Check annually for corrosion, scratches, or wear.
- **Multiple Backups**: Create at least two metal backups, stored in separate, secure locations (e.g., home safe and bank vault).
- **Test Periodically**: Every few years, verify legibility and test on an offline wallet to confirm accuracy.
- **Secure Locations**: Store backups in fireproof, waterproof containers in locations accessible only to you or trusted individuals.

## Conclusion

Stamping your seed phrase into durable materials with a tungsten kit ensures resilience against fire, flood, or time.

To get started:

1. Acquire stainless steel dog tags (or fender washers) and a tungsten stamping kit from a craft store or online.
2. Stamp your seed phrase in a private, offline environment, verifying each word.
3. Test the backup on an offline wallet to confirm accuracy.
4. Store multiple backups in secure, separate locations using tamper-evident containers.
5. Destroy temporary paper backups and maintain air-gap discipline.

*Disclaimer*: Metal seed backups require meticulous handling and secure storage. Verify material quality, stamp accurately, and protect backups from theft or exposure. Self-custody carries risks, and you are responsible for protecting your Bitcoin.
