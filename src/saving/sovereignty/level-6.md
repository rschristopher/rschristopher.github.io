Level 6 enhances your Bitcoin self-custody by creating a durable metal backup of your seed phrase, ensuring your private keys remain accessible even in extreme conditions like fire, flood, or physical damage. This setup builds on [Level 5](../level-5), which uses an air-gapped signing device, a [Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) full node, a Tails OS transaction manager, and an [air-gapped computer](../appendix/airgapped-computer.md). A metal seed backup provides a permanent, resilient solution for storing your 12/24-word BIP-39 seed phrase, protecting wealth equivalent to "your house" against environmental or human threats. This guide focuses on using stainless steel or titanium with metal stamping for durability, recommending [MicroSeed from 21e15.com](https://21e15.com/) for its 1" fender washer solution.

## Why Metal Seed Backup?

A metal seed backup ensures your Bitcoin seed phrase survives disasters that could destroy paper or digital backups. By stamping your seed phrase into durable materials like stainless steel or titanium, you create a fireproof, waterproof, and corrosion-resistant record. Benefits include:

- **Extreme Durability**: Stainless steel and titanium withstand high temperatures (up to 3,000°F for titanium), water, and physical stress, unlike paper or plastic.
- **Longevity**: Metal backups resist degradation over decades, ensuring access to your funds.
- **Security**: Physical backups are offline, immune to digital attacks, and can be stored in secure locations.

This guide recommends stainless steel dog tags or 1" fender washers with a tungsten stamping kit for reliable, cost-effective backups, with [MicroSeed](https://21e15.com/) as a tested solution.

## Choosing Durable Materials

To maximize durability, select materials that resist environmental damage and are suitable for stamping:

- **Stainless Steel**: Affordable, corrosion-resistant, and durable, withstanding temperatures up to ~2,500°F. Ideal for dog tags or washers, available at craft stores or online.[](https://identificationtags.com/blank-stainless-steel-wholesale-pet-tags/)
- **Titanium**: Ultra-durable, fire-resistant up to 3,000°F, and lightweight, but more expensive. Perfect for high-value backups.
- **Tungsten Stamping Kit**: Use a tungsten or steel stamping kit for precise, permanent engraving. Tungsten stamps are harder and more durable, ensuring clear imprints on metal surfaces. Available at craft stores or online retailers like Amazon.[](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Stamping-Machine-Printing-Embossed/dp/B07WSFFJDF)

Avoid softer metals like aluminum, which may degrade or be harder to stamp legibly. Always verify the quality of materials to ensure they meet durability standards.

## Creating a Metal Seed Backup

To create a metal seed backup, you’ll stamp your 12/24-word BIP-39 seed phrase (generated by your signing device in [Level 5](../level-5)) into stainless steel or titanium. The process requires precision and secure handling to protect your seed phrase.

### Materials Needed
- **Metal Medium**:
    - Stainless steel dog tags (available at craft stores or online, e.g., [identificationtags.com](https://identificationtags.com/)).[](https://identificationtags.com/blank-stainless-steel-wholesale-pet-tags/)
    - 1" fender washers (quarter-sized, stainless steel or titanium) for a compact solution, as provided by [MicroSeed](https://21e15.com/).[](https://www.21e15.com)
- **Stamping Kit**: Tungsten or steel stamping kit with letter stamps (e.g., 3mm or 4mm for legibility). Available at craft stores or Amazon.[](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Stamping-Machine-Printing-Embossed/dp/B07WSFFJDF)
- **Stamping Surface**: A flat, hard surface like a steel anvil or brick for stable stamping. A brick is sufficient for home use but may leave slight imperfections on the back.[](https://craftknife.blogspot.com/2017/11/how-to-metal-stamp-dog-tags.html)
- **Safety Gear**: Gloves and safety glasses to protect against metal shards or misstrikes.

### Recommended Product: MicroSeed
[MicroSeed from 21e15.com](https://21e15.com/) is a robust solution for metal seed backups, using 1" fender washers (the size of a quarter) in stainless steel or titanium. Each kit includes:

- **Washers**: Stainless steel, titanium, and nylon options for storing your entire seed phrase on a single washer.
- **Durability**: Fire-resistant up to 3,000°F, crush-proof, and non-corrosive, ensuring long-term reliability.
- **Ease of Use**: Designed for stamping with included or separate tungsten kits, with clear instructions for precise engraving.

MicroSeed’s compact design and material options make it ideal for secure, discreet storage.[](https://www.21e15.com)

### Stamping Process
1. **Prepare the Seed Phrase**:
    - Retrieve the 12/24-word seed phrase from your [Level 5](../level-5) signing device, written on a temporary paper backup during initial setup.
    - Work in a secure, private location with no cameras or onlookers.
    - Destroy the paper backup after stamping to prevent leaks.
2. **Set Up the Stamping Area**:
    - Place the metal medium (dog tag or fender washer) on a flat, hard surface (e.g., steel anvil or brick).
    - Secure the medium with tape or a holder to prevent movement during stamping. Some kits, like MicroSeed, include holders; ensure not to stamp beyond designated areas to avoid damage.[](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Stamping-Machine-Printing-Embossed/dp/B07WSFFJDF)
3. **Stamp the Seed Phrase**:
    - Use a tungsten stamping kit to imprint each word letter by letter. Apply light, consistent pressure to ensure clear, legible imprints.[](https://www.amazon.com/Stainless-Stamping-Machine-Printing-Embossed/dp/B07WSFFJDF)
    - For dog tags, stamp words in sequence (e.g., “1. word1, 2. word2”). For MicroSeed washers, follow the provided template for layout.
    - Double-check each word against the original seed phrase before stamping the next.
4. **Verify the Backup**:
    - Confirm all words are correctly stamped and legible under various lighting conditions.
    - Test the backup by entering the seed phrase into a temporary, offline wallet (e.g., on a fresh Tails OS session) to ensure it matches the signing device’s public addresses.
    - Destroy the temporary wallet session after verification.
5. **Secure the Backup**:
    - Store the metal backup in a tamper-evident bag or container.
    - Place it in a secure, offline location (e.g., safe deposit box, home safe) separate from your signing device and [air-gapped computer](../appendix/airgapped-computer.md).
    - Consider multiple backups in different locations for redundancy, ensuring each is equally secure.

### Security Notes
- **Privacy During Stamping**: Perform stamping in a private, offline environment to avoid exposure.
- **Material Quality**: Verify that dog tags or washers are genuine stainless steel or titanium to ensure durability.[](https://identificationtags.com/blank-stainless-steel-wholesale-pet-tags/)
- **Stamping Precision**: Practice on scrap metal to master the stamping technique before working on the final backup.[](https://craftknife.blogspot.com/2017/11/how-to-metal-stamp-dog-tags.html)
- **Destruction of Temporary Backups**: Burn or shred any paper backups after stamping to eliminate risks.
- **Storage Security**: Use tamper-evident containers and avoid digital photos of the backup.

## Maintaining Your Metal Backup

To ensure your metal seed backup remains reliable:

- **Inspect Regularly**: Check the backup annually for corrosion, scratches, or wear, though stainless steel and titanium are highly resistant.
- **Multiple Backups**: Create at least two metal backups, stored in separate, secure locations (e.g., home safe and bank vault).
- **Avoid Digital Exposure**: Never scan, photograph, or digitize the metal backup, as this could compromise security.
- **Test Periodically**: Every few years, verify the backup’s legibility and test it on an offline wallet to confirm accuracy.
- **Secure Locations**: Store backups in fireproof, waterproof containers in locations only you or trusted individuals can access.

## Integration with Level 5

The metal seed backup complements the [Level 5](../level-5) airgap quarantine, ensuring your seed phrase is preserved even if your signing device or [air-gapped computer](../appendix/airgapped-computer.md) is lost or damaged. The transaction workflow remains unchanged:

- Use the Tails OS transaction manager and Bitcoin Knots node for watch-only operations.
- Sign transactions on the [air-gapped computer](../appendix/airgapped-computer.md) with the signing device, using QR codes or sanitized microSD.
- The metal backup serves as a fail-safe, allowing you to recover your wallet by re-entering the seed phrase into a new signing device if needed.
