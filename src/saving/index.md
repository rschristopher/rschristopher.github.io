# Saving

There is a lot to learn to even attempt
 to answer the question *"is Bitcoin true?"*.
And in general, the best we have, is that
 we can't prove it false.
Maybe one day we will, and we'll realize 
 there was a fundamental flaw that everyone missed.
But until then, Bitcoin remains as true as anything we
 can know, making it the hardest and
 most secure money in the world.

Ready to get started? But where to start?

Often times those curious about Bitcoin
 will find themselves overwhelmed by the
 many passionate and seemingly fanatic
 Bitcoiners.
These zealots (myself included) will overwhelm anyone new to Bitcoin
 with a firehose of information, including
 hard-learned lessons and important
 dangers.
Or we'll talk someone's ear off about 
 [Austrian Economics](https://mises.org/what-austrian-economics)
 or how fiat money is indefensibly immoral.
And yet, due to the 
 [curse of knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge)
 people new to Bitcoin will and should start 
 exactly where most experienced
 Bitcoiners tell them not to (i.e., keeping Bitcoin on an online exchange account).
The truth is, most all Bitcoiners started exactly this same way,
 and made many mistakes along the way.

Inspired by the very excellent 
 [Zero Trust System](https://armantheparman.com/bitcoin-storage-get-better/)
 from 
 [Arman the Parman](https://armantheparman.com/about-contact/),
 I have outlined a series of levels to guide those
 new (and those experienced) towards 
 safe self custody suitable for all levels of savings
 (from pocket change to generational wealth preservation).
The early levels start simple and can serve as a guide
 to avoid the many pitfalls and scams those new
 to Bitcoin will likely encounter.

As you progress, you'll also be learning practical
 knowledge that will allow you to safely and
 confidentaly store larger and larger sums of wealth.
At the higher levels, the extreme sense of ownership
 and the knowledge gained will burn away the
 initial skepticism that many start with.
In fact, I'd recommend to start with skepticism
 and keep in mind the following maxim,

!!! info "*The more one learns about Bitcoin, the more one supports Bitcoin.*"
 
Below is an overview of the levels along with 
 a rough guide on the amount of wealth
 appropriate at each level (that is,
 how much a reasonable person should
 feel comfortable with at each level).

## Sovereignty Levels

* [Level 1: Getting Started](sovereignty/level-1.md) -- Save Bitcoin on a reputable exchange (a small amount that you can risk losing).
* [Level 2: Your Keys](sovereignty/level-2.md) -- Save Bitcoin on a home computer + smartphone (a small amount that you can risk losing).
* [Level 3: Dedicated Hardware](sovereignty/level-3.md) -- Save Bitcoin on a dedicated offline device (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress).
* [Level 4: Full Node Plus](sovereignty/level-4.md) -- Save Bitcoin and run your own node (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress).
* [Level 5: Airgap Quarantine](sovereignty/level-5.md) -- Save Bitcoin with greater security than any bank ever could (as much as you'd be comfortable hiding under your mattress).
* [Level 6: Metal Backup](sovereignty/level-6.md) -- Save Bitcoin with metal backups that can survive a house fire and/or natural disaster (as much as your house is worth).

## Wealth Preservation

Before advancing to higher levels of
 self custody (self sovereignty)
 it is recommended to first focus on
 [Wealth Preservation](wealth/index.md)
 strategies,
 because at this level you should also
 be thinking about
 *your children, inheritance planning,
 and physical security*.

Level 7 and above are use-case specific
 and not as universally relevant as
 the prior levels. 
At this point you can already store any
 amount of wealth
 (even extreme amounts of wealth)
 with more security than any bank or
 institutional custody system could ever offer.

## Advanced Sovereignty Levels
* [Level 7: Multisig Protocols](sovereignty/level-7.md) -- Protocols to manage the complexity of multi-signature keys.
* [Level 8: DMZs](sovereignty/level-8.md) -- Keep your full-node and transaction-manager completely safe from untrusted devices on your network.
* [Level 9: Fault Tolerance](sovereignty/level-9.md) -- Remove all "single points of compromise", in other words, an attacker who compromised a signing device would have no access to your wealth.
* [Level 10: Fail-safes](sovereignty/level-10.md) -- Require fully redundant networks with explicit verification of cryptographic signatures.
* [Level 11: Countermeasures](sovereignty/level-11.md) -- Electronic countermeasures to safeguard against "NSA-level" threats.
* [Level 12: Off-grid](sovereignty/level-12.md) -- Receive-only (e.g., satellite) nodes with offline transaction management requiring remote and geographically distributed key signing and redundant online drop-points (points to transmit).

Before you begin this journey and question everything you thought you knew about money,
 you may want to first
