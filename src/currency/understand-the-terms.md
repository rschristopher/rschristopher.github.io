# Understand the Terms

While saving in Bitcoin involves
 new concepts
 that don't otherwise exist in
 traditional economic models
 (such as a cryptographic ledger or UTXO sets),
 Bitcoin commerce 
 is well aligned with
 traditional economics.
The goal is simply to make
 and receive payments.
For businesses it means
 selling goods and services --
 getting paid in Bitcoin.
For customers it means
 paying for goods and services --
 as easily as you would
 pay in cash.

If you're coming from a fiat mindset,
 that is, commerce within fiat currency,
 Bitcoin commerce might seem odd at first,
 but you'll
 find it similar
 to *traditional* (pre-fiat)
 business models.
This is because most of those traditional
 business models developed under a gold
 standard (a sound money standard).

As a result, you may find commerce
 under a Bitcoin standard to be
 intuitive and simple,
 almost naive,
 with none of the complex
 financialization one finds in modern fiat.
There are however some new concepts,
 in particular new technical concepts
 that are worth understanding.
We will describe and help demystify these
 new concepts, especially those
 necessary for understanding commerce
 in Bitcoin.










## Lightning Network

Lightning is a Bitcoin payment network
 (proposed in this 2016
 [whitepaper](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf)).
It allows virtually unlimited scaling
 of Bitcoin payments;
 and is built on top of the
 Bitcoin network as a
 second-layer network.
In other words, the base-layer
 network has no visibility
 into lightning payments,
 but only provides
 final settlement of
 lightning channels.

In effect, Lightning
 is a network of channels
 between peer-to-peer
 Bitcoin nodes.
Each channel
 provides liquidity
 between two nodes;
 a balance on each side.
Lightning routes payments
 through the channels,
 allowing users anywhere
 in the network to send
 and receive Bitcoin 
 anywhere else on the
 network
 (provided there is sufficient
 liquidity in the channels).

There are plenty of

 [resources](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/understanding-the-lightning-network-part-building-a-bidirectional-payment-channel-1464710791)
 to understand the implementation
 details of the Lightning Network,
 and while still very early it
 has seen widespread early adoption.

### Public Channels

The above is a map of all *public* lightning channels.
A public channel is simply a routable channel
 connected to the broader lightning network.
This is a peer-to-peer network that
 routes payments anywhere.
Another way to think about it,
 these are the channels that are
 not otherwise hidden.
Public channels (and nodes) are
 discoverable on sites such as
 [1ml](https://1ml.com/),
 [amboss.space](https://amboss.space/),
 or through LnRouter,

  <figcaption>LnRouter -- exploring public nodes</figcaption>
</figure>

Importantly, anyone can use
 the Lightning Network,
 and anyone with a node
 (a Bitcoin
 full node
 with lightning software) can join.
To join,
 simply request to open a channel
 with one of the nodes on the network.
The moment you have at least one open
 channel, your node will be discoverable
 by others.
Additionally, a well-connected node
 could potentially earn
 sats by routing
 payments.





### Private Channels 

A private channel is simply a channel
 between two nodes that is not otherwise
 discoverable.
Private channels 
 (and entire private networks)
 can easily be created 
 for situations where all participants
 wish to remain private.
For example, payments between
 nation states or business
 entities wishing to remain private.

Importantly, maintaining privacy
 requires an implicit trust
 amongst all participants in
 a private network.
Should one of the nodes
 create a routable channel
 to the public Lightning Network,
 this would (depending on the software
 and configuration) make this
 formerly private network
 part of the public network.
