# Level 3: On-Chain Payments

Non-custodial on-chain payments enable direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, exactly as Bitcoin was intended to be used. This is a critical step towards personal sovereignty, sending and receiving Bitcoin securely. For example, a local merchant might pay a supplier directly with BTC for monthly inventory, or a freelancer could receive client payments, all recorded immutably on-chain. This mirrors traditional commerce under a gold standard but with digital precision.

This level is about true control over payments, free from custodial risks, but it comes with trade-offs: on-chain fees and confirmation delays make it less practical for small and frequent payments. It’s a critical step toward financial independence, ideal for significant transactions.

## How It Works

- **Setup**: Install a non-custodial wallet (e.g., Electrum or Sparrow). Generate a seed phrase to secure and back up your keys, ideally with [metal backups](../../savings/sovereignty/level-6.md) for durability. Store it offline safely. See [Savings](../../savings/) for details.
- **Payments**: Send Bitcoin to any address or receive payments to your wallet’s unique addresses, managed via hierarchical deterministic (HD) setups for privacy. Transactions are broadcast to the Bitcoin network for confirmation.
- **Settlement**: On-chain transactions confirm in ~10 minutes per block, providing final international settlement but with fees that can be costly for small amounts.
- **Examples**: A local merchant sends BTC to a supplier for goods, or a family receives remittances directly, avoiding custodial freezes.

## Strengths

- **Full Control**: You manage your own transactions; no third party can censor, freeze, or interfere with your payments — true sovereignty.
- **Security**: Cold storage protects against hacks, unlike custodial services.
- **Privacy**: HD wallets generate new addresses per transaction, enhancing anonymity compared to custodial KYC.

## Weaknesses

- **Responsibility**: Losing your seed phrase means losing access to your Bitcoin — no recovery without backups.
- **High Fees**: On-chain fees make small payments (e.g., coffee) impractical.
- **Confirmation Delays**: Waiting ~10 minutes per block isn’t ideal for instant commerce, unlike Lightning.
- **Learning Curve**: Managing transactions and software requires more effort than custodial apps.

## Reputable Software

Focus on Bitcoin-only, secure software from trusted providers. Avoid multi-asset wallets with added risks. Key criteria:

- **Non-Custodial**: You must manage your own private keys and transactions.
- **Open-Source**: Code transparency ensures security (e.g., Electrum’s audited codebase).
- **Bitcoin-Only**: Avoid complexity and vulnerabilities of “crypto” wallets.
- **Backup Support**: Seed phrase compatibility for recovery across devices.
