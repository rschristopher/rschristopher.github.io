# Sovereignty


!!! warning "work in progress"


In our world of global fiat there are no true sovereigns -- the machinations of the state have turned even the wealthiest and most productive members of society into effective debt slaves.
Slaves to a fiat system with broken incentives, whose wealth is determined by proximity to a money printer -- more specifically, the bureaucratic class of public sector employees with access to unlimited fiat money through government debt, as ultimately the central banks are beholden to the government to keep them in business. The central banks "create" the money from nothing, which only works through the unholy alliance of the government and its organs (including the military). 
This alliance has an unsolvable bad actor problem that has been successfully exploited by a grotesque network of so-called NGOs and "aid organizations" -- parasitic grifters who have found a true loophole to siphon unmeasured wealth from the productive members of society into a bureaucratic hellscape of incompetent ideologues who are mostly unaware of their deleterious effect on civilization.

These are effectively courtiers and courtesans to an enpty throne, a modern idol every bit as demonic as the ancient gods.
Whether we like it or not, this is the end state of global fiat.
In a very practical way, we have become the playthings of demons (the ideologies possessing the debt slaves).

Bitcoin, right now, enables financial sovereignty.
It is available to anyone, but not for everyone.
No one is explicitly excluded, yet in the final analysis the baae-layer will only support tens of millions of true sovereign entities conpeting over truly scarce resources, while the rest of humanity will be holding holds wealth through trusted intermediaries.
While there may be future innovations that can enable 2nd and 3rd layer global payment rails, we're currently in a situation where the entire world relies on fraudulent intermediaries of fiat central banking and the demonic antihuman ideologies that engenders.

~50 million sovereigns
12 billion subjects, all working with
 one or more sovereigns.

How does the sovereign pay their subjects?
157-million transactions per year, maybe 10-1000
times the number of transaction outputs.
In other words, the average sovereign has ~1000
 outputs per lightning channel.
If each output could be put into an L3 lightning
 wallet, then all subjects could easily work
 for one or more sovereigns.
The L3 wallet is just a Bitcoin wallet, an
 address is used as the basis of their L3
 payments.
Make as many as you want, the L3 takes those
 as pseudonymous payment destinations, creating
 payments based on an address and a UTXO
 (or a designated L2 amount).
You can get paid only when there's a UTXO
 cryptographically signed to your address
 and part of the existing channel.
L3 simply needs to ensure no double spending,
 exactly as L2 does.
E.g., make an L2 payment
 and use that to designate L3 funds?
This way an employer locks real wealth to your
 address, with a covenant for you to get paid,
 should you deliver the work.
Once the money is yours, it's yours... 
You can be a sovereign if you so choose, or
 just save and spend it on L3 rails.

lightning channrl is 2-2 multisig, bouncing a transaction back snd forth and not spending.
This channel can close, and all thats needed is L3 wallet, a separate transaction that takes an infinitely divisivle slice of a UTXO away from the 2-2 multisig, and is spendable on any lightning channel.
HD wallet addresses, with tiny frwction of a UTXO, but that UTXO might get moved to a change address.
The new UTXO at rhe change address must carry forward the info needed that the old UTXO can be spendable at the new.
