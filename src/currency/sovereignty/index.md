# Sovereignty Levels

In today's economy, dominated by global fiat, true sovereignty has vanished. Even the wealthiest and most productive are reduced to debt slaves where wealth flows not from value creation but from proximity to the money printer. Central banks, propped up by government alliances and their organs -- including the military -- create money from nothing, fueling a bureaucracy riddled with bad actors. Parasitic networks of NGOs and so-called aid organizations exploit this, siphoning resources from society into a maze of inefficiency and ideology, blind to their harmful influence. These are modern courtiers serving an empty throne, as destructive as ancient idols. This is the grim reality of fiat: a world of pawns to dehumanizing systems.

## Bitcoin’s Promise
Bitcoin offers a way out. It enables financial sovereignty for anyone willing to seize the opportunity. Bitcoin’s scarce on-chain resources will support tens of millions of true sovereigns -- entities free from intermediaries, competing for control over their wealth. Unlike fiat’s fraudulent central banking, Bitcoin’s decentralized, peer-to-peer nature fosters a sound money standard, echoing the simplicity of gold but built for a digital age. While future innovations may scale this freedom to billions, today’s intermediaries and their antihuman incentives still bind most to this broken system.
