# Level 4: Lightning Payments

Non-custodial Lightning payments allow for fast, low-cost Bitcoin transactions for everyday commerce, completely aligned with your on-chain sovereignty. Using wallets like Phoenix or Blue Wallet, you open payment channels on the Lightning Network -- a second-layer network atop Bitcoin -- to send and receive sats instantly with minimal fees. For example, a local merchant might accept BTC for daily sales at a market, or a freelancer could pay suppliers globally, all without waiting for blockchain confirmations. This mirrors the speed of cash but with Bitcoin’s security and global reach.

This level scales your ability to use Bitcoin as a currency, ideal for frequent, small payments. However, managing channels requires some setup and liquidity knowledge. For key management details, see the [saving section](../../saving/).

## How It Works

- **Setup**: Install a non-custodial Lightning wallet (e.g., Phoenix or Blue Wallet). Generate a seed phrase to secure and back up your keys, ideally with metal backups for durability. Store it offline safely. See [saving section](../../saving/) for details on seed words, metal backups, and protocols.
- **Channels**: Fund a channel by sending an on-chain transaction to create a shared balance with a counterparty. Update the channel as needed by agreeing on new balances off-chain.
- **Payments**: Send or receive sats by entering an amount or scanning a QR code/invoice in your wallet. Payments route through the network and settle instantly.
- **Examples**: A merchant accepts BTC for goods via Phoenix, or a freelancer pays international invoices instantly through Blue Wallet.

## Strengths

- **Speed and Cost**: Near-instant transactions with negligible fees, perfect for micropayments like buying coffee or streaming sats.
- **Sovereignty**: Non-custodial wallets ensure you control your keys and funds, avoiding third-party risks.
- **Scalability**: Lightning supports high transaction volumes off-chain, all while preserving Bitcoin’s base-layer security.

## Weaknesses

- **Setup Complexity**: Opening channels requires on-chain transactions, which incur fees and delays, plus basic understanding of liquidity.
- **Liquidity Management**: You need inbound/outbound liquidity to send/receive, which can be tricky without Lightning Service Providers (LSPs).
- **Online Requirement**: Wallets must be online to route payments, though watchtowers can monitor for fraud when offline.
- **Early Stage**: Lightning is still developing, with occasional routing failures or software bugs.

## Choosing a Reputable Wallet

Focus on Bitcoin-only, non-custodial Lightning wallets from trusted providers. Avoid multi-asset wallets with added risks. Key criteria:

- **Non-Custodial**: You must manage your own keys and transactions.
- **Open-Source**: Transparent code ensures security (e.g., Phoenix’s audited codebase).
- **Bitcoin-Only**: Avoid complexity and vulnerabilities of “crypto” wallets.
- **Lightning Support**: Must integrate seamlessly with the Lightning Network, ideally with LSP compatibility.
