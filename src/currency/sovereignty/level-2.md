# Level 2: Physical Tokens

Sometimes you want to transfer Bitcoin privately and completely offline — physical Bitcoin bearers make this possible. Devices like OpenDime (a USB stick) or Satscard (an NFC card) act as "digital cash," loaded with sats and passed hand-to-hand. Imagine a local community of businesses — farmers, artisans, and shopkeepers — settling periodically or just one-time trades: a farmer loads an OpenDime with Bitcoin earned from sales, hands it to a supplier for goods, who verifies it offline via USB or NFC. No apps, no KYC, just trust-minimized exchange, echoing gold settlements in traditional economies.

This approach emphasizes privacy and simplicity for offline commerce, avoiding the surveillance and delays of online transactions. It's ideal for unbanked areas and privacy-conscious groups, but it's a specific tool, not the endgame of sovereignty.

## How It Works

- **Setup**: Acquire a device (e.g., OpenDime from Coinkite), load it with Bitcoin via any wallet, and seal it to make it tamper-evident.
- **Transfers**: Hand the device to the recipient, who verifies the balance and integrity offline (USB for OpenDime, NFC for Satscard). The bearer now controls the funds without broadcasting.
- **Settlement**: For reuse or larger trades, "unseal" to access the private key and sweep funds on-chain, but this is one-time per device for true bearer status.
- **Examples**: A local merchant passes a loaded Satscard to a supplier for inventory, settling quarterly, without fees or confirmations.

## Strengths

- **Ease and Simplicity**: No software or internet needed for transfers — just plug in or tap to verify, easier than gold coins.
- **Privacy**: Fully offline, no transaction records on-chain until swept, perfect for discreet local settlements.
- **Trust-Minimized**: Tamper-evident design ensures integrity, enabling peer-to-peer commerce without intermediaries.

## Weaknesses

- **Physical Limitations**: Restricted to in-person handovers; can't scale for remote or high-volume trades.
- **Risk of Loss/Theft**: Like cash, if lost or stolen, funds are gone — no recovery without backups.
- **One-Time Use**: Devices like OpenDime become spendable only after unsealing, requiring new ones for repeated use; eventual on-chain settlement exposes to fees and delays.
- **No Scalability**: Unsuitable for micropayments or global commerce; verification requires compatible hardware.

## Reputable Bearer Instrument

Focus on Bitcoin-only, secure devices from trusted makers. Avoid "crypto" gadgets with added risks. Key criteria:

- **Tamper-Evident**: Ensures no prior access to keys.
- **Offline Verification**: Must confirm balance without Internet.
- **Bitcoin-Only**: Steer clear of multi-asset support for security.
