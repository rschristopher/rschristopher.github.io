# Level 1: Custodial

Starting your journey with Bitcoin as a currency begins with custodial access — the simplest way to dip your toes into Bitcoin commerce. Using third-party services like exchanges (e.g., River Financial, Swan Bitcoin) or custodial wallets (e.g., Wallet of Satoshi), you can buy, hold, send, and receive Bitcoin without managing keys or hardware. It's like using a digital bank for Bitcoin, perfect for beginners to experiment with payments or remittances.

We'll start with ease over sovereignty. You're relying on intermediaries, mirroring fiat systems, with risks of censorship or loss. Think of it as a training ground: learn Bitcoin's flow as a currency, then move toward self-custody to escape fiat-like controls.

## How It Works
- **Setup**: Create an account on an exchange or custodial wallet app, often requiring identity verification (KYC). Deposit fiat via bank transfer or card, or receive Bitcoin directly.
- **Payments**: Send Bitcoin to addresses for purchases or receive it for sales, often with built-in Lightning support for fast, cheap transactions. On-chain transactions take time to confirm (about 10-minutes per block) but provide final international settlement.
- **Examples**: A local merchant accepts BTC via Wallet of Satoshi for quick sales, or a freelancer receives remittances through River.

## Strengths
- **Ease of Use**: No technical setup — use a smartphone or laptop to start buying or selling instantly.
- **Fast Onboarding**: Ideal for testing Bitcoin as a currency, with Lightning enabling near-instant micropayments (e.g., coffee purchases).
- **Accessibility**: Connects you to Bitcoin's economy without needing hardware or software expertise.

## Weaknesses
- **No Control**: You don’t hold your keys, so the service controls your Bitcoin. Funds can be frozen, censored, or lost due to hacks or platform failures.
- **Privacy Loss**: KYC requirements expose personal data, unlike Bitcoin’s pseudonymous potential.
- **Fiat-Like Risks**: Mirrors the vulnerabilities of banks — subject to terms of service, outages, or regulatory shutdowns.

## Choosing a Reputable Service

Many services are unreliable or outright scams. Experienced Bitcoiners know "crypto" platforms often fail. Always check the following:

- **Withdrawal Support**: Must allow transfers to self-custody; otherwise, you hold an IOU, not Bitcoin. Selling for fiat is taxable in the US.
- **Bitcoin-Only**: Avoid platforms offering other cryptocurrencies — security risks increase with complexity.
- **Future-Focused**: Seek services with Lightning integration or Bitcoin-centric features for reliability.
- **No Yield Scams**: Steer clear of promised returns or vague yield products signaling insolvency risks.

Custodial access is a low-friction start to using Bitcoin as a currency, but it’s not true sovereignty. Once comfortable sending and receiving, shift to [higher levels](level-2.md) for hands-on, trust-minimized trades without internet reliance, setting the stage for greater independence.
