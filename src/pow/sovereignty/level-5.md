# Level 5: Enterprise Scaling

Scale your mining farm to enterprise levels, pushing hashrate to find blocks every 2-3 months. This expansion turns your operation into a dominant force, converting massive energy inputs into consistent sovereign Bitcoin while maintaining full control over your proof-of-work hashrate.

## Setup

Expand your [Level 4](level-4.md) farm with 50-100 large ASIC miners in an industrial facility. Use the same efficient models as before, but deploy at volume.

Requirements:

- Industrial site: data center or custom build with 1-2 MW power draw
- Low-cost electricity
- Dedicated full node: [Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/)
- Stratum server: [CKPool](https://bitbucket.org/ckpool/src/master/) or [public-pool](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson/public-pool)
- Container with cooling system with space for 50-100 mines, e.g., [Avalon Box](https://shop.canaan.io/products/products-avalon-air-cooling-mining-boxvariantsid10191), or check options from [power-mining](https://www.powermining.io/)

## Scaling

With only 100 ASIC miners a single server running a dedicated full node and stratum should be more than sufficient, although you may want to consider a backup server for fault tolerance. Each miner can support 3 stratum URLs, and it's recommended to configure them with a primary, backup, and a tertiary backup at one of the hosted solo pools from [Level 2](level-2.md).

At 50 PH/s against ~935 EH/s network hashrate and 126.27T difficulty (July 2025), expect λ ≈ 2.81 blocks/year (~ one every 4.3 months). Double to 100 PH/s for λ ≈ 5.62 (~ every 2.2 months). Poisson variance adds unpredictability, averaging 2-3 months per block.

Maximize uptime with automated maintenance, power redundancy, and custom scripts (e.g., Python for API monitoring) to oversee miners and detect issues swiftly.

!!! info "Repair Bench"
    At this scale, you'll want a separate repair bench, along with a few miners ready to be deployed to replace any bad miners. There may be fan issues, power supply issues, control board issues, or the more costly hashboard issues..

## Monitoring Shares

Log high-difficulty shares to track farm health -- shares prove your 50-100 PH/s delivery, independent of outsiders.

Activate logging in your stratum config; record shares, times, and difficulties. Analyze with Python scripts for effective hashrate (actual vs. expected).

Low rates highlight problems like failures or throttling. Use dashboards for alerts; this turns scale into sovereign strength.

## Why Enterprise?

Enterprise scaling yields reliable sovereign blocks -- producing Bitcoin straight from your farm, free from KYC taint or exchange risks. These blocks are pure, enabling custom inscriptions or transaction priority under your command.

Finding blocks every 2-3 months creates a steady sovereign supply, shielding against volatility and affirming independence in centralized finance's shadow. It's proof-of-work's zenith, forging energy into untouchable wealth.

Embrace it: enterprise delivers consistent sovereign blocks, anchoring your Bitcoin stance.
