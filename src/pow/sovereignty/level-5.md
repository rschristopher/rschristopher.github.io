# Level 5: Enterprise

Scale your mining farm to enterprise levels, pushing hashrate to 50-100 PH/s to find blocks every 2-3 months. This expansion turns your operation into a dominant force, converting massive energy inputs into consistent sovereign Bitcoin while maintaining full control over proof-of-work.

## Setup

Expand your [Level 4](level-4.md) farm with 50-100 large ASIC miners in an industrial facility. Use the same efficient models as before, but deploy at volume for 50-100 PH/s total.

Requirements:
- Industrial site: data center or custom build with 1-2 MW power draw
- Low-cost electricity (<$0.03/kWh in regions like Quebec or Texas)
- Dedicated full node: [Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) with high peering and `dbcache`
- Stratum server: [CKPool](https://bitbucket.org/ckpool/src/master/) or [public-pool](https://github.com/benjamin-wilson/public-pool)
- Cooling systems: immersion or hydro to handle 100-200 kW heat

Link your scaled farm to the stratum server, leveraging your sovereign pool for seamless integration.

## Scaling for Block Frequency

At 50 PH/s against ~935 EH/s network hashrate and 126.27T difficulty (July 2025), expect λ ≈ 2.81 blocks/year (~ one every 4.3 months). Double to 100 PH/s for λ ≈ 5.62 (~ every 2.2 months). Poisson variance adds unpredictability, averaging 2-3 months per block.

Maximize uptime with automated maintenance, power redundancy, and custom scripts (e.g., Python for API monitoring) to oversee rigs and detect issues swiftly.

## Monitoring Shares

Log high-difficulty shares to track farm health -- shares prove your 50-100 PH/s delivery, independent of outsiders.

Activate logging in your stratum config; record shares, times, and difficulties. Analyze with Python scripts for effective hashrate (actual vs. expected).

Low rates highlight problems like failures or throttling. Use dashboards for alerts; this turns scale into sovereign strength.

## Why Enterprise?

Enterprise scaling yields reliable sovereign blocks -- producing Bitcoin straight from your farm, free from KYC taint or exchange risks. These blocks are pure, enabling custom inscriptions or transaction priority under your command.

Finding blocks every 2-3 months creates a steady sovereign supply, shielding against volatility and affirming independence in centralized finance's shadow. It's proof-of-work's zenith, forging energy into untouchable wealth.

Embrace it: enterprise delivers consistent sovereign blocks, anchoring your Bitcoin stance.

!!! warning "Avoid FPPS and Mining Pools"
    FPPS pools tempt with steady flows, but centralize hashrate and enable fraud like withholding. Stay solo; pools trade freedom for fiat mirage.
