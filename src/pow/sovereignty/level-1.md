# Level 1: Network Reliance

If you're sovereign in [saving](../../saving/index.md) and [currency](../../currency/index.md) -- controlling your keys and transacting peer-to-peer with no intermediaries -- but you do not participate in mining (proof-of-work hashing), then you are still trusting third parties to secure your wealth and process your transactions. Bitcoin's proof-of-work hashing is a ruthless, zero-sum competition where miners vie to validate blocks, enforce the supply cap (securing your wealth from inflationary theft), prevent abuse like double-spends, all through sheer computational power. Yet, without joining this fray, your sovereignty remains incomplete -- reliant on anonymous miners for finality and security. Recognize this gap to claim full sovereignty.

You broadcast transactions via wallets or block explorers, depending on miners to incorporate them into the blockchain. Absent your own hardware, the network's aggregate hash rate performs the work -- proving work at escalating difficulties, adjusting every 2016 blocks to maintain ~10-minute intervals, all while you stand outside the arena.

!!! quote "The Man in the Arena, Teddy Roosevelt"
    It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

## Exposing the Vulnerabilities

Sovereignty in [saving](../../saving/index.md) and [currency](../../currency/index.md) falters without proof-of-work involvement, as miners hold the reins on processing and integrity, signaling readiness for soft forks -- and if you're not in the game, what will you do, complain to the manager? In this adversarial zero-sum game, passivity invites exploitation.

Critical vulnerabilities:

- **Transaction Censorship**: Miners, incentivized by fee markets or coerced by regulations, can orphan blocks or deprioritize your UTXOs -- leaving you powerless amid rising RBF (Replace-by-Fee) dynamics or MEV (Miner Extractable Value) strategies.

- **Rule Enforcement Blind Spots**: You presume adherence to consensus parameters like subsidy halvings or OP_RETURN limits, unverified by personal hashing. Subtle attacks -- inflation via covert bugs or contentious soft forks -- could erode your holdings undetected.

- **Base-Layer Fragility**: Self-custodial vaults and Lightning channels depend on miners for anchoring and dispute resolution. Pool centralization -- as demonstrated by China's 2021 mining ban dispersing >50% of hash rate -- amplifies systemic risks, potentially enabling reorgs and 51% attacks.

Such third-party trust replicates fiat's pitfalls. True escape lies in wielding hash power yourself.

!!! success "Proof-of-Work Hashing is Why Bitcoin is Superior to Gold"
    There are many disadvantages to gold, evidenced by the fact that gold inevitably produced central banks and fiat money. And thus it remains to be seen if "digital gold" can escape that same fate. But there is a critical and underlooked difference between Bitcoin and gold -- it is not because Bitcoin is digital that it is superior, it is because Bitcoin requires *proof-of-work* for both issuance **and** transaction settlement.
    
    Think about it. Transacting in gold requires no work and is the weak point that led to gold's downfall. Try that same strategy with Bitcoin, proof-of-work hashing, despite the ugliness of the game, prevents an equivalent Nixon Shock with Bitcoin. Bureaucrats and politicians have no power over Bitcoin, only proof-of-work hashing has power (actual measurable power). And it turns out that the one thing even the smartest bureaucrats can never do, is real work. They will not only fail to stop Bitcoin, they won't and can't understand it -- because it requires real work.

## Entering the Arena

For any Bitcoiner advanced in [saving](../../saving/index.md) and [currency](../../currency/index.md), the call to mining will only grow louder. You've mastered only *two-thirds* of Bitcoin sovereignty.

Proverbs 10:4 cautions: "A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich." Awareness of third-party dependence marks wisdom; active hashing forges enduring prosperity.

Take your first steps into the arena. [Level 2](level-2.md) deploys an entry-level ASIC, syncing a full node, and directing hashes to a solo pool. This verifies Bitcoin's permissionless ethos, hones your edge in the competition, and fortifies the network against centralization.

Don't expect any early wins. Even without any statistical hope of mining a block, you'll be in the dirt and grime of the game: real-time hash rate, hash-price indexes, modeling difficulty adjustments, and sourcing affordable rigs. Proof-of-work hashing is not for everybody, but neither is sovereignty.
