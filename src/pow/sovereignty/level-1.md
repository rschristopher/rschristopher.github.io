# Level 1: Network Reliance

# Doing Nothing 



- **Transaction Censorship**: Miners, incentivized by fee markets or coerced by regulations, can orphan blocks or deprioritize your UTXOs -- leaving you powerless amid rising RBF (Replace-by-Fee) dynamics or MEV (Miner Extractable Value) strategies.

- **Rule Enforcement Blind Spots**: You presume adherence to consensus parameters like subsidy halvings or OP_RETURN limits, unverified by personal hashing. Subtle attacks -- inflation via covert bugs or contentious soft forks -- could erode your holdings undetected.

- **Base-Layer Fragility**: Self-custodial vaults and Lightning channels depend on miners for anchoring and dispute resolution. Pool centralization -- as demonstrated by China's 2021 mining ban dispersing >50% of hash rate -- amplifies systemic risks, potentially enabling reorgs and 51% attacks.

Such third-party trust replicates fiat's pitfalls. True escape lies in wielding hash power yourself.

!!! success "Proof-of-Work Hashing is Why Bitcoin is Superior to Gold"
    There are many disadvantages to gold, evidenced by the fact that gold inevitably produced central banks and fiat money. And thus it remains to be seen if "digital gold" can escape that same fate. But there is a critical and underlooked difference between Bitcoin and gold -- it is not because Bitcoin is digital that it is superior, it is because Bitcoin requires *proof-of-work* for both issuance **and** transaction settlement.
    
    Think about it. Transacting in gold requires no work and is the weak point that led to gold's downfall. Try that same strategy with Bitcoin, proof-of-work hashing, despite the ugliness of the game, prevents an equivalent Nixon Shock with Bitcoin. Bureaucrats and politicians have no power over Bitcoin, only proof-of-work hashing has power (actual measurable power). And it turns out that the one thing even the smartest bureaucrats can never do, is real work. They will not only fail to stop Bitcoin, they won't and can't understand it -- because it requires real work.

## Entering the Arena

For any Bitcoiner advanced in [saving](../../saving/index.md) and [currency](../../currency/index.md), the call to mining will only grow louder. You've mastered only *two-thirds* of Bitcoin sovereignty.

Proverbs 10:4 cautions: "A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich." Awareness of third-party dependence marks wisdom; active hashing forges enduring prosperity.

Take your first steps into the arena. [Level 2](level-2.md) deploys an entry-level ASIC, syncing a full node, and directing hashes to a solo pool. This verifies Bitcoin's permissionless ethos, hones your edge in the competition, and fortifies the network against centralization.

Don't expect any early wins. Even without any statistical hope of mining a block, you'll be in the dirt and grime of the game: real-time hash rate, hash-price indexes, modeling difficulty adjustments, and sourcing affordable rigs. Proof-of-work hashing is not for everybody, but neither is sovereignty.
