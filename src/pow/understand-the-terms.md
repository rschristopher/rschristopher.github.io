# Understand the Terms

*Mining* is perhaps the most confusing
 metaphor within all of Bitcoin.
It can be better understood as 
 transaction processing, allowing
 for *final international settlement* --
 as well as 
 for issuance, ensuring that the
 supply schedule stays on its predetermined
 course.
Unfortunately, there's no one word to adequately
 describe all of that, hence the circumlocutions
 necessary to describe what 
 Bitcoin "mining" really is.

For these reasons, we've called this section
 *Proof of Work*.
Because for better or worse, the entirety
 of Bitcoin mining, international settlement
 processing, whatever you want to call it --
 all rests on top of what is known as a
 *proof of work* consensus mechanism.

We will attempt to demystify *proof of work*
 and provide a clear and technically accurate
 understanding of how mining works.

 









## Hashing 

Despite how often it is said,
 Bitcoin mining is not concerned with
 solving complex math problems.
Bitcoin mining is just *hashing*.
The "proof" in *proof of work* is simply
 a hash that *proves*
 a certain amount of hashing (that is, *work*)
 was done.
The important part is not the math function,
 the important part is the *proof of work*.

???+ question "what is a hash?"
    A "hash" refers to the output of a
     [hash function](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function),
     which is a math function that takes
     input of any size and maps it to a 
     fixed-sized output.
    A good hash function should be deterministic,
     with uniformly distributed output,
     and be non-reversable
     (that is, you cannot determine what
      the input was if you only have the
      output).

    A hash function can certainly be
    considered a "complex math function"
    (not exactly a "math problem"),
    but that is decidedly not the point
    of Bitcoin hashing -- the point
    is *proof of work*.

The output set of a hash function 
 (that is, the set of all possible outputs)
 can be
 small (useful for data indexing) or
 extremely large (useful for cryptography).
Bitcoin mining uses
 [SHA-256](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).


### SHA-256

SHA-256 is a hash function that
 maps any input into a number somewhere between
 0 and 2<sup>256</sup>.
This set of numbers is so large it's on the scale
 of *atoms in the universe*.
It's so astronomically large that the chance
 two human-generated
 inputs mapping to the same output
 (what would be known as a collision)
 is considered so infeasible as to be
 impossible.
And in fact there are exactly *zero* known
 collisions in SHA-256
 and finding a collision would
 likely take beyond the heat death of the
 universe to discover.

That said, what if instead of a collision,
 you just wanted to find an input whose
 SHA-256 output was
 smaller than a target number?
If it's a very large target number, say 
 2<sup>255</sup> then this would be trivial
 (50% of all inputs would produce
 a hashed output smaller than that, basically
 a coin toss).
But if it was a very small target number, then it
 would be extremely difficult to find *any*
 input that produced a hashed output
 that was smaller.

???+ example "For example"
    Let's look at some example SHA-256 outputs,
    
    ```
    1 => 6B86B273FF34FCE19D6B804EFF5A3F5747ADA4EAA22F1D49C01E52DDB7875B4B
    2 => D4735E3A265E16EEE03F59718B9B5D03019C07D8B6C51F90DA3A666EEC13AB35
    3 => 4E07408562BEDB8B60CE05C1DECFE3AD16B72230967DE01F640B7E4729B49FCE
    ```
    ```
     three => 8B5B9DB0C13DB24256C829AA364AA90C6D2EBA318B9232A4AB9313B954D3555F
     Three => 926F52D1C1E19C0C58A7D39BF234A0D239352F5ACFA26C73989D9C3845614999
    Three? => F9DCE11BE6E27EA81231A766A4210EAA05D51E4C5F5F79C8FD0133274201D543
    ```
    
    Each output is a hexadecimal representation
    of a number (that is, a very large base-16 number).
    Notice that small changes in the input 
    produce radically different outputs.
    In fact, there's no way to predict
    where in the 2<sup>256</sup> output set
    a given input will land (other than to
    perform the SHA-256).
    And as expected, exactly 50% of those
    outputs are less than 2<sup>255</sup>.
    
    Also notice that none of these output
    numbers are particularly small.
    For comparison, let's look at the
    SHA-256 output of the Bitcoin genesis block,
    
    [`00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048`](https://blockstream.info/block/00000000839a8e6886ab5951d76f411475428afc90947ee320161bbf18eb6048)

    Notice the leading zeros.
    This number is clearly much smaller than
    the previous SHA-256 outputs.
    In this case the target was 

    [`00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)

    And indeed the SHA-256 output of the genesis
    block is smaller than this target.

    Compare this to a more recent block hash, block 772244,

    [`000000000000000000032c4341255c7b108f3982b71b6e734d25b89bb9b1cc41`](https://blockstream.info/block/000000000000000000032c4341255c7b108f3982b71b6e734d25b89bb9b1cc41)
    
    By looking at the leading zeros it is obvious that this number
    is considerably smaller than the genesis block
    (and thus more work was required to find an input that
     produced such a small SHA-256 output).
    In fact, the probability of guessing an input
    with a SHA-256 output that small is so small
    that you're more likely to be struck by
    lightning every day of the week at noon.

    

This simple observation
 is the basis
 of Bitcoin mining.
Importantly, finding input whose
 SHA-256 hash output
 is smaller than a target
 can only be done
 through a brute force search;
 and thus the very existence of
 such an input
 would *prove* a certain amount of
 brute force *work*
 was done.

???+ info "Other hash functions"
    In addition to SHA-256, Bitcoin makes use of
    other hash functions; in particular 
    [RIPEMD-160](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIPEMD),
    used in conjunction with SHA-256 to generate
    Bitcoin addresses.

    However, within Bitcoin mining 
    *proof of work*, it is
    entirely a game of SHA-256 hashing.


### Hashrate

As the name implies, hashrate is
 simply the number of SHA-256
 hashes per-second happening
 in order to successful discover
 a new block.
There are great real-time
 [visualizations](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#1y)
 of hashrate over time.
Hashrate across the entire Bitcoin
 network is estimated based
 on the time between blocks
 and the current network difficulty.
In general, the faster you are
 producing valid blocks for
 a given difficulty, the
 more hashrate you have.

Importantly, hashrate is the
 measure of total work being
 done.
From a protocol perspective,
 we only care about
 hashrate, and not the
 physical energy consumed
 by the miners to produce 
 that hashrate.
Energy usage (e.g, in Watts or Joules-per-Terahash-second)
 is entirely dependent on the 
 mining devices themselves.
And this simple inflection
 point of Watts to Hashrate
 is where the realm of
 abstract mathematics
 unites with our physical
 world.
This is ultimately why
 Bitcoin has value, because
 producing Bitcoin takes real
 energy in the real world
 (measured in Watts),
 and it does so through
 a fixed and known
 supply schedule.




## ASICs

*Application-Specific Integrated Circuit* or
 [ASIC](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)
 is nothing new, and in Bitcoin mining this
 refers to a specific chip that calculates
 [SHA-256](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2)
 hashes (and nothing else).
However, an "ASIC" can also refer 
 to the mining device itself
 (which has hundreds
 of ASIC chips).

Initially, Bitcoin mining happened on
 CPUs, and then GPUs.
And due to economic incentives mining moved to
 [FPGA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array)
 chips and then eventually to modern ASICs.
At every step of this evolution the incentives
 are pointing to the maximum amount of
 hashrate for the minimum amount of
 electricity consumption.

It is difficult to know what the next
 evolution of Bitcoin mining technology
 will be.
It might be quantum ASICs
 powered by clean nuclear energy.
It might be highly decentralized
 commodity ASICs producing hash
 from geothermal energy.
Whether it be advances in
 quantum computing,
 or advances in energy production,
 Bitcoin mining will be incentivizing
 much needed innovation.







## Difficulty

Difficulty is the measure
 of how difficult it is to find
 a valid block.
Every
 2016
 blocks the difficulty will be adjusted
 to match a 10-minute average time
 between blocks.
In other words, if blocks are
 coming in faster than every
 10-minutes, the difficulty
 will increase; if blocks
 are coming in slower,
 the difficulty will decrease.

The formula for difficulty is based
 on the target number discussed
 above.
Specifically,

```
difficulty = difficulty_1 / target
```

And `difficulty_1` is the highest possible target allowable in Bitcoin
 (in other words the lowest allowable difficulty),
```
difficulty_1 = 00000000FFFF0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```

Note that as *difficulty* increases
 the target number decreases
 (that is, it becomes more difficulty
 to find a SHA-256 hash less
 than the target).



### Network Difficulty

Network difficulty refers to
 the difficulty across
 the entire Bitcoin network.
That is, the difficulty needed
 to find a valid block.
When Bitcoin was first released
 in 2009
 the network difficulty was 1.0,
 and this number slowly increased
 as more participants joined
 and started mining.
By 2012 the difficulty
 was over a million
 (that is, over a million times more difficulty).

In the age of ASICs, the
 network difficulty has
 grown astronomically large,
 and
 [continues](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/hashrate-difficulty#all)
 to grow.
For example, block 772244 (mentioned above)
 has a difficulty of 37,590,453,655,497.09
 (over 37-trillion).
This corresponds to a *hashrate*
 of over 250 exahash --
 that is, over 250-quintillion
 SHA-256 hashes per-second.

To put this into perspective,
 if we attempted to log all of
 the quintillions of hashes
 per-second
 then we would exhaust
 all know storage space
 (all cloud storage,
  all personal computers,
  all mobile devices)
 in only a few seconds.
Bitcoin's global hashrate is now so large
 it has outgrown our
 current (and otherwise impressive)
 global data storage capacity.



### Session Difficulty

Typically, session difficulty refers to the
 specific difficulty assigned to a miner.
While the network difficulty is used to
 find a valid block, the session difficulty
 is a way to find valid *shares* that act as
 a *proof of work* for an individual miner
 (or a pool of miners).
For example, a modern ASIC might use a
 session difficulty of 65,536 and generate
 valid shares every few seconds.

A share is simply a block
 that meets the session difficulty
 (but not necessarily the
 network difficulty).
These shares are themselves a
 *proof of work*, specifically it is
 *proof* that a given miner did work.



### Share Difficulty

A valid share must meet the session difficulty,
 which just means its SHA-256 hash is
 smaller than the target
 computed from the session difficulty.
In other words,
 every share will have its own difficulty which
 is greater than the session difficulty.
And if the share difficulty is greater than
 the network difficulty then that share
 is a block!






## Luck

Luck is a measure of -- you guessed it -- *luck*.
Specifically, the *luck* of finding a 
 valid block in
 a given period of time.
It's similar to the probability of finding
 a block given a specific amount of hashrate.
Technically, luck is simply the following
 formula given shares between two blocks,

```
sum(session_difficulty) / network_difficulty
```

In other words, if luck is 1.0 (100%) then you
 mined a block when your own *proof of work*
 was equal to the current network difficulty.
If your luck measure was greater than 1.0
 then this is bad luck
 (meaning you did more work for that
 one block than implied by the current network difficulty).
And if your luck was less than 1.0
 then this is good luck
 (meaning you found a block before doing
 all the work implied by the network difficulty).
In practice, the luck between any two blocks
 will vary, sometimes good and sometimes bad luck.
However, the average luck over time
 should convergence
 on 100% (by definition).

Over a period of N blocks, luck is simply,

```
sum(session_difficulty) / (N * network_difficulty)
```

In a perfectly efficient and error-free system,
 luck will converge on 100% as N gets larger.
And if luck is greater than 1, even by a small
 fraction, say, 1.02 (102%), then that denotes
 bad luck -- meaning you didn't mine as many
 blocks as you should have for the hashrate
 you produced.
Imagine you did the work for 102 blocks
 but were rewarded 100 blocks.
This might just be legitimate *bad luck*.
But over time, let's say you earned 1,000 blocks
 with a luck of 102%, meaning you missed 20 blocks --
 this is persistent bad luck, and is
 not statistically feasible, and thus
 is a sign something is wrong with your miners
 (block withholding, rejected orphaned blocks,
 compromised firmware, etc).









## Blocks

Ultimately, the entire goal of Bitcoin mining
 is to find and propagate blocks.
Finding a block means finding a valid block
 whose SHA-256 hash is less than the
 current network difficulty target.
More specifically, the hash of the
 *block headers*
 must meet this difficulty,
 and the block itself must
 be valid
 (otherwise the *nodes*
  in the Bitcoin network
  will reject this block).

### Block headers

A block header is composed of a small
 number of fields that when input
 into a SHA-256 will produce a
 hash that is less than the target 
 (computed from the network difficulty).

* `version` -- a 4-byte field used to track version, and (since [BIP-9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki)) is used to signal for soft forks (backwards compatible upgrades to the protocol)
* `timestamp` -- a 4-byte field containing the Unix timestamp; must be greater than the average of the previous 11-blocks and less than 2-hours past the current network-adjusted timestamp 
* `difficulty` -- a 4-byte compressed representation of the current network difficulty
* `nonce` -- *number used only once*, a 4-byte number used by miners in order to test different hashes
* `previous block hash` -- a 32-byte field holding the SHA-256 of the previous block -- this ensures that no previous transaction was modified
* `merkle root` -- a 32-byte field holding the Merkle tree of all transactions in the block

When mining Bitcoin, the `nonce`
 is directly modifiable to work on.
However, modern ASICs will exhaust
 the 4-bytes of `nonce` instantly.
Miners could potentially
 use the variance in the `timestamp`,
 artificially adjusting the `timestamp`
 such that it's still
 valid (according to the consensus rules).
But in practice `nonce` and a handful
 of bits of `timestamp` do not give 
 sufficient search space for modern
 ASIC miners (with all their hashing power)
 -- instead,
 modern ASIC miners modify the transactions,
 typically the coinbase (the very first
 transaction in a block),
 adding `extranonce` fields.
 Because this will modify transactions this
 will require a new
 `merkle root` for every variation.

The `merkle root` is a Bitcoin-specific
 [Merkle Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree)
 which is effectively a SHA-256 hash of hashes
 of all the transactions in a given block.
The purpose of a Merkle Root is to prove
 that a given set of transactions produces
 a given SHA-256 hash
 (a way to validate that the transactions
  in a given block were not modified).

### Block height and weight

Every block has
 a valid *proof of work* hash,
 and is also indexed by its
 block height.
Block height is simply the number
 of blocks prior to any given block,
 and is an easy way to reference
 a given block.
E.g., block height
 [772,615](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000003af8ff6f35d69425cc88d4af0be2312e1a74f8223ca4c)
 has exactly 772,615 blocks
 prior to it.

If you look at the details of a given block,
 e.g., block
 [772,615](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000003af8ff6f35d69425cc88d4af0be2312e1a74f8223ca4c)
 you will see that it also has a *block weight*,
 in this case, 3.99 MWU.
The block weight is simply the size
 of a block, measured in 
 [weight units](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weight_units)
 where *MWU* is *million weight units*.


### Block propagation

Once a miner finds a new block
 it needs to propagate that block
 to the rest of the network.
Typically, this is done through the
 [submitblock](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/submitblock.html)
 RPC command in
 [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin).
Failure to propagate quick enough can
 result in an *orphan* or stale block,
 which means the miner gets zero reward
 despite their proof of work.

Once a miner submits a new block,
 the p2p network of Bitcoin nodes
 will propagate the new block
 (each node verifying the
 *proof of work* and validity).
Historically, this process was
 somewhat slow.
However, since
 [BIP-152](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki)
 the nodes propagate
 blocks using a compact
 message format that only includes
 block headers and
 a compact list of transaction IDs.
Because each full node
 manages its own mempool,
 it already has most of the
 transactions, so it's
 able to assemble the
 block quickly
 (only fetching transactions
 that it doesn't already
 know about).


<figure markdown>
  [![block propagation time](/images/block-prop-time.png)](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/bitcoin/#propagation)
  <figcaption>Block propagation time (at 50% and 90% of total network)</figcaption>
</figure>

Compact block messages
 led to a signifant 
 reduction in block propagation time,
 which in turn
 greatly reduces the risk
 of oprhaned blocks.















## Pools

Mining is all about probability.
If you're a large miner with 10%
 of the total hashrate, then you
 will be expected to mine 10% of the
 total number of blocks.
There are on average 144 blocks per day,
 so 10% is 14.4 blocks per day.
A miner with 1% would average 1.4
 blocks per day, and so on.

But what about small miners?
What about an individual mining device?

Let's look at block 
 [772,793](https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000003f2b0cedf601824c02ba9ad129ca3531502dca525c635).
This block was mined through
 [Solo CK](https://solo.ckpool.org)
 purportedly by an individual miner
 with only 10 terahash.
10 terahash out of 284 exahash (at the time).
That's 10 / 284,000,000.
This means they will mine 
 0.0000003% of all blocks,
 and statistically should take
 about 540 years before finding
 a block.

This rare luck aside, most individual mining
 devices will never find a block, ever.
A mining device might have an operational
 life of 10 years, probably less,
 which is far less than the centuries
 it would take to find a block.
Blocks are finite, 144 per day,
 52-thousand per year.
And there are millions of miners, all
 competing against the ever increasing
 network difficulty.

This was a problem even early in Bitcoin's
 history.
As a result, in 2010, pooled mining was born.
The idea is simple, pool your hashrate and
 share the reward based on contributed hashrate.
A small miner doesn't have to wait 540 years
 or be extremely lucky --
 they can get paid a small amount daily.

Miners in a pool
 use the pool's coinbase address, and
 expect payout from the pool
 (as their shares *prove* they did
 work for the pool).
There are different payout strategies
 where risk is either shared amongst pool
 participants, or the risk is owned entirely
 by the pool itself.
Additionally, work is coordinated
 across all the participants of a pool
 through a protocol
 known as *stratum*.



### Stratum

For better or worse,
 [stratum](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Stratum_mining_protocol)
 is the defacto protocol for pools
 to manage workers.
It is a raw-socket protocol using
 newline-delimited JSON
 (rather than websockets or any other standard).
And while
 [stratum v2](https://stratumprotocol.org/)
 promises to solve many of the
 problems with stratum,
 until there's wide adoption
 of v2 in mining firmware,
 stratum will remain the standard.

Importantly, modern firmware
 lacks the ability to call
 [getblocktemplate](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getblocktemplate.html)
 on a full node, and simply requires
 a stratum url in order to 
 function.
There is no technical reason for this,
 but a consequence of market demand
 for fleets of ASICs and pooled mining.
If you have a modern ASIC,
 you will need a stratum server
 (from a pool or otherwise)
 to start mining.

### Pay-per-Share

This is the most common payout strategy
 for pools, and is typically *full-pay-per-share* (FPPS).
You may see PPS or PPS+ as slight 
 variations of this strategy.
Simply put, the risk is on
 the pool itself and not the miners.
The miners get paid for their shares
 regardless of whether the pool is
 propagating blocks.
In fact, the risk of orphans or any
 operational inefficiency is owned
 by the pool
 (even if there's a problem with one of the miners).

An FPPS pool will set a session-difficulty
 and an FPPS rate,
 and a miner gets paid for all shares
 above that difficulty.
If a share happens to be a block,
 the miner gets paid for just another share.
If the miner withholds 
 a block (intentionally or accidentally),
 the miner loses only a
 negligible amount of payout,
 and the pool loses an entire block.

While this strategy has proven
 very popular in recent years,
 it is unlikely to survive as
 a viable
 business model --
 and in fact
 most FPPS pools offer other
 services to offset their
 (predictable)
 losses.


### Pay-per-Last-N-Shares

This is an alternative pool strategy, 
 abbreviated as PPLNS with variations
 like SPLNS.
In this payout strategy, risk
 is shared amongst all miners 
 in the pool.
The miners get paid when the
 pool mines a block, and
 the payout is based
 on their recent shares.

If there is block withholding
 (intentional or otherwise)
 every miner in the pool
 suffers, finding that their
 *luck* measure becomes
 persistently bad.
For this reason, most miners
 prefer FPPS pools, especially
 if they can negotiate a low
 (or no) FPPS fee.


### Solo

Because of the requirement
 for stratum servers
 and the complexity of
 block propagation, some
 pools offer
 a *solo* mode.
In this strategy, risk
 is owned entirely by
 each miner, they either
 mine blocks or they don't.
The pool operator is paid
 a fee for providing
 a stratum service 
 alongside well-peered
 full nodes for block
 propagation.

Importantly, if a miner
 is using a pool for solo
 mining, they are entirely
 dependent on that pool
 for efficient worker management
 (that is, coordinating 
 work amongst a fleet of miners),
 as well as for propagating
 blocks.
And because the miner owns
 all of the risk, using a
 pool for solo mining
 is only viable for those
 that lack the engineering
 resources to manage
 stratum servers and 
 full nodes.
Otherwise, solo mining
 is best done, well, *solo* --
 as in, run your own
 stratum server and full node.
