# Proof-of-Work

Bitcoin transactions are processed through
 a highly competitive system of
 *proof-of-work* hashing, aka *mining*.
This is also, coincidentally, how Bitcoin
 is issued and how issuance stays on
 a fixed supply schedule -- which is how the total supply of Bitcoin will remain fixed, forever.

While most people will be
 [saving](../saving/)
 and
 [spending](../currency/) in Bitcoin,
 very few will be involved
 in mining, and far fewer will be successful.
Ultimately, the mechanism that guarantees
 final international settlement is a
 highly competitive (and adversarial)
 zero sum game.

For those foolish enough to play this game
 -- *and for some it's more a matter of fate than want* --
 the only way to be successful is a
 combination of competence, luck, and
 by far the most important: a ridiculous 
 work ethic.

> “Always poor is he who works with an indolent hand, but the hand of the diligent brings wealth” (Proverbs 10:4)

If you're looking for passive income or an exciting investment opportunity,
 Bitcoin mining is most certainly not
 for you.
However, if honest hard work is just your kind of game, well then -- welcome to the
 [arena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_in_a_Republic).
Proof-of-work hashing is what gives Bitcoin its security, and what allows for final international settlement.
And while it is adversarial and zero-sum, it is open to everybody.
Anyone can attempt to find and propagate blocks.
In fact, to truly gain your own financial sovereignty, then mining your own blocks guarantees you can settle your own on-chain transactions.


## Sovereignty Levels

* [Level 1: Start Hashing](sovereignty/level-1) -- run a miner pointed to a mining pool
* [Level 2: Hash Farms](sovereignty/level-2) -- run a farm of Bitcoin miners
* [Level 3: Demand Response Curtailment](sovereignty/level-3) -- run miners only when doing so is profitable, maximizing hashrate within available (i.e., profitable) power
* [Level 4: Solo Mining](sovereignty/level-4) -- run a full node and a stratum server
* [Level 5: Block Broadcasting](sovereignty/level-5) -- run a well-peered network of nodes
* *[future]* [Level 6: Opensource Firmware](sovereignty/level-6) -- *future inevitability*, opensource firmware, maximizing efficiency 
* *[future]* [Level 7: Commodity Hardware](sovereignty/level-7) -- *future inevitability*, custom hardware and novel machine configuration 

Before diving in and daring to test your fate in the Bitcoin mining arena, you may want to first
