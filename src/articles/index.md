This is a collection of essays
 and information centered around
 a single question.
It is a question most worth pursuing.
**Is Bitcoin True?**

In other words, we aim to understand:
 is Bitcoin money?
Is the fixed supply of Bitcoin truly fixed?
Will this solve the problems
 of seigniorage and fiat currency?

We will not be satisfied
 with shallow
 [criticism](criticisms/)
 and hype.
We want to know whether or not
 there is truth to Bitcoin.
And we will go as deep as
 necessary to discover this
 truth.
