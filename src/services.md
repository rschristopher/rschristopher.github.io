**Bitcoin is simple. Doing it right isn't.**

We help individuals, families, and businesses take real ownership of their Bitcoin -- without custodians, centralized dependencies, or unnecessary third parties. Everything we do is rooted in helping clients understand and execute their own sovereignty path, one piece at a time.

As a sovereign, you will never be dependent on us. We are here to help you gain true sovereignty.

## Saving

**Self-custody for real ownership and long-term security.**

Bitcoin isn’t savings unless you hold your own keys. We help clients take control of their custody setups — with careful attention to privacy, durability, and independence from custodians or custodial hardware/software platforms.

We offer guidance on:

- Wallet selection and cold storage workflows
- Multisig setups with coordinator independence
- Inheritance strategies that don’t rely on third parties
- Secure key storage and recovery practices
- Minimizing reliance on any single vendor or company

The goal is not just "not your keys, not your coins" — it’s knowing that your setup will still work decades from now, and that your loved ones can access it when needed.

## ⚡ Currency

**Use Bitcoin as a payment layer -- without giving up control.**

Most payment integrations are custodial at some level — hosted wallets, fiat ramps, cloud servers. We help you move toward self-hosted, sovereign systems that reflect Bitcoin’s design.

- Deploy BTCPay Server on your own infrastructure
- Set up Lightning nodes and connect to relevant peers
- Design payment flows that avoid SaaS reliance
- Understand privacy tradeoffs in receiving and spending
- Integrate Bitcoin payments into real businesses, cleanly

This isn’t about gimmicks — it’s about making Bitcoin useful, fast, and sovereign at the same time.

## Proof of Work

**Run miners, support the network, build hashrate — on your terms.**

Bitcoin mining is for everyone, not just institutions. But the incentives only work if your setup is intentional. We help clients approach mining from first principles, reflecting the same values that guide custody and payments: decentralization, privacy, and independence.

Depending on your context, we offer:

- Guidance on acquiring and setting up ASICs
- Introduction to firmware and pool selection
- Layout advice for home or colocated deployment
- Monitoring and planning based on your actual goals

We do not run hosted miners. We help you run your own.

## Custom Projects

Some clients need more. We occasionally take on bespoke work — custom dashboards, scripting, or integrations — where we can offer clear value and stay aligned with our principles.

- Open-source–oriented, maintainable code
- Built for long-term independence, not support lock-in
- Always with full source control and client ownership

If you’re building something serious and sovereign, we may be able to help.

## Consultation

We offer flexible, one-on-one consulting for clients who want to skip the rabbit hole but still get it right:

- Custody design sessions
- Payment infrastructure walkthroughs
- Mining setup strategy calls
- Retainer-style engagements

Our [pricing](prices.md) is simple and predictable. Start by telling us what you’re trying to accomplish.
