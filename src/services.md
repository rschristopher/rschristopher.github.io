We offer services to help individuals, families, and businesses take real ownership of their Bitcoin
-- without custodians, without unnecessary third parties. 
Everything we do is rooted in helping clients understand and execute their own sovereignty path, one piece at a time.

As a sovereign, you will never be dependent on us. We are here to help you gain true sovereignty.
**Bitcoin is simple. Doing it right isn't.**

## [üîê Saving](saving/index.md)

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt yours unless you hold your own keys. 
We help clients take control of their custody setups ‚Äî with careful attention to privacy, durability, and independence from custodians or custodial hardware/software platforms.

- Wallet selection and cold storage workflows
- Multisig setups with coordinator independence
- Inheritance strategies that don‚Äôt rely on third parties
- Secure key storage and recovery practices
- Remove reliance on any single vendor or company

The goal is more than just "not your keys, not your coins"
 -- it‚Äôs knowing that your wealth is secure now and in the future, and that your loved ones can access it when needed.

## [‚ö° Currency](currency/index.md)

Most payment integrations are custodial at some level ‚Äî hosted wallets, fiat ramps, cloud servers. 
We help you move toward self-hosted sovereign systems that reflect Bitcoin‚Äôs design.

- Deploy BTCPay Server on your own infrastructure
- Set up Lightning nodes and connect to relevant peers
- Design payment flows that avoid SaaS reliance
- Understand privacy tradeoffs in receiving and spending
- Integrate Bitcoin payments into real businesses, cleanly

This isn‚Äôt about gimmicks ‚Äî it‚Äôs about making Bitcoin useful, fast, **and sovereign**.

## [‚õèÔ∏è Proof of Work](pow/index.md)

Bitcoin mining is not for everyone; but neither is true sovereignty.
We help clients approach mining from first principles, reflecting the same values that guide custody and payments: decentralization, privacy, and independence.

- Guidance on acquiring and setting up ASICs
- Introduction to firmware and running your own pool (stratum server)
- Tooling for demand-response curtailment
- Monitoring and planning based on your actual goals

We do not run hosted miners. We help you run your own.

Some clients need more, and this is where we excel.
We often take on bespoke work 
 -- custom dashboards, custom integrations 
 -- if you‚Äôre building something serious and sovereign, we may be able to help.

- Open-source‚Äìoriented, maintainable code
- Built for long-term independence, not support lock-in
- Always with full source control and client ownership

And we offer flexible, one-on-one consulting for clients who want expert guidance.

- Custody design sessions
- Payment infrastructure walkthroughs
- Mining setup strategy calls
- Retainer-style engagements

Our [pricing](prices.md) is simple and predictable. Start by telling us what you‚Äôre trying to accomplish.
